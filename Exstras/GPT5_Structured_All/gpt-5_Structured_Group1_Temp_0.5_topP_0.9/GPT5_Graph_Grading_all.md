Here are the marks for each student (out of 3), using the memo’s three criteria: shape, x‑intercept (1;0), and respecting the y‑axis asymptote.

- S1: 2/3 – per exemplar: incorrect shape; x‑intercept indicated; asymptote respected.
- S2: 3/3 – correct log shape; (1;0) shown; does not cross y‑axis.
- S3: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) shown; asymptote respected.
- S4: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) written; no crossing of y‑axis.
- S5: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) indicated; asymptote respected.
- S6: 0/3 – per exemplar: exponential/incorrect; crosses y‑axis; no (1;0).
- S7: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) marked; asymptote respected.
- S8: 2/3 – shape OK and asymptote respected; (1;0) not shown.
- S9: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) shown; asymptote respected.
- S10: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) indicated; asymptote respected.
- S11: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) shown; asymptote respected.
- S12: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) shown; asymptote respected.
- S13: 2/3 – shape OK and asymptote respected; (1;0) not shown.
- S14: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) shown; asymptote respected.
- S15: 2/3 – shape OK and asymptote respected; (1;0) not shown.
- S16: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) shown; asymptote respected.
- S17: 2/3 – shape roughly log‑like and asymptote not crossed; (1;0) not shown.
- S18: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) indicated; asymptote respected.
- S19: 2/3 – log branch drawn with correct shape and asymptote; (1;0) not shown.
- S20: 2/3 – shape OK and asymptote respected; (1;0) not clearly shown.
- S21: 3/3 – correct shape; (1;0) shown; asymptote respected.
- S22: 0/3 – incorrect shape; crosses y‑axis; no (1;0).
- S23: 0/3 – no axes/incorrect presentation; no (1;0); asymptote not addressed.
- S24: 1/3 – log‑like shape drawn, but no axes so (1;0) not shown and asymptote not verifiable.
- S25: 0/3 – no graph meeting criteria.
- S26: 0/3 – blank/no graph.

If you want any reconsiderations for borderline cases (e.g., S10 or S20), say which ones and we can review them more strictly or more leniently.
