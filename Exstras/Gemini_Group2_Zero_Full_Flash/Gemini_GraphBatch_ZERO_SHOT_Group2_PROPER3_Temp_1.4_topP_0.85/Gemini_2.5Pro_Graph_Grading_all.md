Here is the grading for each student's graph based on the provided memo. The memo criteria are:
1.  **vorm (stygende log funksie)**: Shape (rising logarithmic function) - 1 mark
2.  **x-afsnit**: x-intercept at (1,0) - 1 mark (must be marked/labeled)
3.  **assimptoot**: Asymptote (y-axis or x=0) - 1 mark

**Total Marks: 3 per graph**
