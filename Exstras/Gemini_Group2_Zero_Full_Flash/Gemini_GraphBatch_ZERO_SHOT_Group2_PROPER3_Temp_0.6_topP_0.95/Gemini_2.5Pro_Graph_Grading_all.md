*   **Grade: 3/3**

**S8:**
*   **Shape:** Partially correct. It is an increasing curve, but its behavior near the origin is not typical of a logarithmic function's asymptote. (1/1)
*   **x-intercept:** Incorrect. The graph appears to intersect the x-axis around x=0.5 or (0,0) if the arrow leads there, not at (1,0). (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. The graph does not clearly show a vertical asymptote at x=0. The arrow on the left points towards the origin horizontally, suggesting it might start at or near (0,0) rather than approaching the y-axis asymptotically. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 1/3**

*   **Shape:** Correct. It's an increasing logarithmic curve. (1/1)

**S15:**
*   **Shape:** Correct. It's an increasing logarithmic curve. (1/1)

*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. The open circle at (0,0) implies the graph starts *at* (0,0) (but not including it), rather than approaching x=0 as a vertical asymptote where the function value tends to negative infinity. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 1/3**

**S16:**
*   **Shape:** Correct. It's an increasing logarithmic curve. (1/1)
