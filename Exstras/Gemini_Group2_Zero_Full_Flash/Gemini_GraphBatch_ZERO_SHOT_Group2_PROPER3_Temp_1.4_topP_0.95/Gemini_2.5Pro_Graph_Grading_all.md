Here is the grading of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo. The memo specifies three criteria, each worth 1 mark, for a total of 3 marks:

1.  **Vorm (stygende log funksie)**: Correct shape (increasing logarithmic function). This means a curve that is increasing from left to right, bending to represent a logarithm.
2.  **x-afsnit**: Correct x-intercept at (1,0). This point should be either clearly labeled or precisely indicated on the graph.
3.  **Assimptoot**: Correct vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0). The graph should approach the y-axis but not cross it, extending downwards towards negative infinity.

**S1: 0/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph is composed of linear segments, not a smooth logarithmic curve. (0 marks)
*   **x-intercept:** The graph's x-intercept is at (1,0), but because the overall shape is incorrect, this point does not represent the x-intercept of the required logarithmic function. (0 marks)
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. A linear graph does not have a vertical asymptote like a logarithmic function. (0 marks)

**S2: 3/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic shape. (1 mark)
*   **x-intercept:** Correctly labeled (1,0). (1 mark)

**S6: 3/3 Marks**

*   **x-intercept:** Clearly passes through (1,0) based on the axis labeling, although not explicitly labeled. (1 mark)

**S7: 3/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic shape. (1 mark)
*   **x-intercept:** Correctly labeled (1,0). (1 mark)
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly shown approaching the y-axis. (1 mark)

**S8: 0/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Partially correct curve shape, but the left arrow suggests a horizontal asymptote or extending into negative x-values, which is incorrect for a standard logarithmic function. (0 marks)
*   **x-intercept:** (1,0) is neither labeled nor clearly indicated as the x-intercept. Based on the scaling, the curve appears to pass above the x-axis at x=1. (0 marks)
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. The graph does not clearly show a vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (0 marks)

**S9: 3/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic shape. (1 mark)
*   **x-intercept:** Correctly labeled (1,0). (1 mark)

*   **x-intercept:** Correctly labeled (1,0). (1 mark)
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly shown approaching the y-axis. (1 mark)

**S11: 0/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph is composed of linear segments, not a smooth logarithmic curve. (0 marks)
*   **x-intercept:** The graph's x-intercept is at (1,0), but because the overall shape is incorrect, this point does not represent the x-intercept of the required logarithmic function. (0 marks)

*   **Asymptote:** Correctly shown approaching the y-axis. (1 mark)

**S13: 0/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph is linear, not a logarithmic curve. (0 marks)
*   **x-intercept:** While it passes through x=1 (if the unlabeled tick mark is 1), the point (1,0) is not explicitly labeled, and the linear nature means it's not the x-intercept of a log function. (0 marks)
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. A linear graph does not have a vertical asymptote. (0 marks)

**S14: 3/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic shape. (1 mark)
*   **x-intercept:** Correctly labeled (1,0). (1 mark)
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly shown approaching the y-axis. (1 mark)

**S15: 0/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** The curve is increasing, but its behavior near the origin is incorrect. It appears to approach (0,0) as an open circle rather than extending infinitely downwards along a vertical asymptote. (0 marks)
*   **x-intercept:** Incorrect. The graph does not pass through (1,0). The point x=1 is significantly below the x-axis. (0 marks)
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. No vertical asymptote is shown; instead, it appears to stop or approach (0,0). (0 marks)

**S16: 3/3 Marks**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic shape. (1 mark)
*   **x-intercept:** Correctly labeled (1,0). (1 mark)
