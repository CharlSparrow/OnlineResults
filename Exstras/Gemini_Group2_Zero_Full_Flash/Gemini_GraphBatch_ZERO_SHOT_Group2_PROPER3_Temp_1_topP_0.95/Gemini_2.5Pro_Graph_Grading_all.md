Here's a detailed grading of each student's graph based on the provided memo:

**Grading Rubric (3 marks total):**
1.  **Shape (vorm):** Correct increasing logarithmic curve (1 mark)
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** Marked or clearly passing through (1,0) (1 mark)
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** Vertical asymptote at x=0 (y-axis) implied or explicitly drawn (1 mark)
*(Note: Other points like (1/2, -1) or (2,1) are not explicitly part of the 3-point rubric, but they reinforce the correct shape and function, and errors in these points can indicate a misunderstanding that impacts the "shape" mark.)*

**S21:**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. While it's an increasing curve, the point (1/2, 1) is inconsistent with an increasing logarithmic function with an x-intercept at (1,0) and an asymptote at x=0. For an increasing log function `y = log_b(x)` (with b>1), if it passes through (1,0), it should pass through (1/b, -1), not (1/2, 1). This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the function's behavior. (0/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Correct. (1,0) is clearly marked. (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. Although the y-axis is shown as a boundary, the curve's behavior near it (given (1/2,1)) is not that of a correct increasing log function approaching x=0. (0/1)
