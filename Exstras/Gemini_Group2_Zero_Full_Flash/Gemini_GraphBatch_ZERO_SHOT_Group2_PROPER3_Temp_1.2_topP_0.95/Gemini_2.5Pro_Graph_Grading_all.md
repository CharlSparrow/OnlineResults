Here is the grading for each student's graph based on the provided memo. The memo criteria are:
1.  **vorm (stygende log funksie)**: Shape (increasing logarithmic function) - 1 mark
2.  **x-afsnit**: x-intercept at (1,0) - 1 mark
3.  **assymptoot**: vertical asymptote at x=0 (y-axis) - 1 mark
**Total: 3 marks per graph**

*   **S1**:
    *   Shape: Incorrect (linear, not logarithmic). (0 marks)
    *   x-intercept: Correct (1,0) is shown. (1 mark)
    *   Asymptote: Correct (approaches y-axis). (1 mark)
    *   **Grade**: 2/3 (Initially I marked it 0/3 for shape, but the question asks to "grade the graphs using the memo". The memo has 3 distinct points. Shape is specifically 'vorm (stygende log funksie)'. A linear graph, while having a general shape, is not the *shape of an increasing log function*. So, the shape point should be 0. The x-intercept and asymptote *can* be correct for a different function type if it happens to match the points/lines. So, re-evaluating strictly by memo: 1 mark for x-intercept, 1 mark for asymptote, 0 for shape. Total 2/3).
