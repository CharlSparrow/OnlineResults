Here's the grading of each student's graph based on the provided memo. The memo specifies three criteria, each worth 1 mark, for a total of 3 marks:

1.  **Vorm (Shape):** Must be a smooth, rising, concave-down logarithmic curve, consistent with the specific function `h^-1` (which is `y = log_2(x)` based on the points (1,0) and (1/2, -1) on the memo).
2.  **x-afsnit (x-intercept):** Must clearly show the x-intercept at (1,0) (either labeled or clearly indicated by a point on the axis).
3.  **Assymptoot (Asymptote):** Must clearly show the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical asymptote.

**Student Grades:**

*   **S1:**
    *   Shape: 0/1 (Piecewise linear, not a smooth curve)
    *   x-intercept: 1/1 (Correctly marked at (1,0))
    *   Asymptote: 0/1 (Not clearly represented as a vertical asymptote for a curve)
    *   **Total: 1/3**

*   **S2:**
    *   Shape: 1/1 (Correct smooth, rising log curve, consistent with `log_2(x)`)
