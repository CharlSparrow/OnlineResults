Here's the grading of each student's graph based on the provided memo and the understanding that `h^-1` refers to the function `y = log_2(x)`, as implied by the points shown in the memo graph (e.g., (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).

**Grading Criteria (Total 3 Marks):**
1.  **Form & Asymptote (1 Mark):** The graph is a smooth, rising logarithmic curve that approaches the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical asymptote.
2.  **X-intercept (1 Mark):** The graph clearly passes through the point (1,0).
3.  **Specific Function Accuracy (1 Mark):** The graph accurately represents `y = log_2(x)`, indicated by passing through at least one additional correct specific point shown in the memo (e.g., (1/2, -1), (2,1), (4,2), (8,3)).
