Thanks for the memo. I marked each graph out of 3 using the three criteria:
- correct shape (rising log curve)
- correct x-intercept at (1;0)
- vertical asymptote at x=0 shown

Here are the results.

S1: 2/3 – shape and asymptote OK, but x-intercept labelled as (0;1).
S2: 3/3 – shape, x-intercept (1;0) and asymptote all correct.
S3: 3/3 – all correct.
S4: 3/3 – all correct.
S5: 3/3 – all correct.
S6: 2/3 – shape and asymptote OK; x‑intercept (1;0) not indicated.
S7: 3/3 – all correct.
S8: 1/3 – general rising shape, but no clear asymptote and no x‑intercept shown.
S9: 3/3 – all correct.
S10: 3/3 – all correct.
S11: 3/3 – all correct.
S12: 3/3 – all correct.
S13: 1/3 – rising shape only; asymptote and x‑intercept missing.
S14: 3/3 – all correct.
S15: 1/3 – rising shape only; asymptote and x‑intercept missing.
S16: 3/3 – all correct.
S17: 2/3 – shape and x‑intercept OK; asymptote at x=0 not shown.
S18: 3/3 – all correct.
S19: 2/3 – shape and asymptote OK; x‑intercept not indicated.
S20: 3/3 – all correct.
S21: 3/3 – all correct.
S22: 0/3 – not the required log shape; no x‑intercept or asymptote.
S23: 0/3 – no usable graph.
S24: 1/3 – looks like log shape but axes/asymptote and x‑intercept missing.
S25: 0/3 – no graph to mark.
S26: 0/3 – blank.

If you want any score adjusted after moderation, tell me which specific criterion you’d like to relax or enforce more strictly.
