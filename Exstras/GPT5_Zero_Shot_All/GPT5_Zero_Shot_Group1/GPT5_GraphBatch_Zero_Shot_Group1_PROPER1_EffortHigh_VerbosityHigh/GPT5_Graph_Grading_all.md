Marks per student (out of 3)
- S1: 2/3 – correct form and asymptote; x‑intercept labelled as (0;1) → wrong.
- S2: 3/3 – correct form, (1;0) shown, asymptote at x=0.
- S3: 3/3 – correct form, (1;0) shown, asymptote at x=0.
- S4: 3/3 – correct form, (1;0) shown, asymptote at x=0.
- S5: 3/3 – correct form, (1;0) shown, asymptote at x=0.
- S6: 0/3 – not a single log curve; no correct intercept or asymptote.
- S7: 3/3 – correct form, (1;0) shown, asymptote at x=0.

- S21: 3/3 – correct form, (1;0) shown, asymptote at x=0.
- S22: 0/3 – no recognisable log graph/intercepts/asymptote.
- S23: 0/3 – curve with no axes or required features.
- S24: 1/3 – log‑like curve but no axes/labels → no intercept or asymptote.
- S25: 0/3 – no graph provided.
- S26: 0/3 – blank.
