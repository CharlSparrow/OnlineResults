Thanks for the memo. I marked each student on the 3 memo criteria:
- correct shape: increasing log curve (1)
- correct x-intercept at (1;0) (1)
- vertical asymptote x = 0 shown/clearly implied (1)

Grades (X/3) with a short note:

- S1: 1/3 – x‑intercept at (1,0) shown, but line segments and no asymptote.
- S2: 3/3 – correct log shape, (1,0), y‑axis asymptote.
- S3: 3/3 – correct shape, passes (1,0), approaches y‑axis.
- S4: 3/3 – correct curve, (1,0) and asymptote indicated.
- S5: 1/3 – mostly a straight line; (1,0) shown; no asymptote.
- S6: 0/3 – inverse drawn as a straight line; wrong shape and intercept.
- S7: 3/3 – correct shape, points (1,0), (2,1), (4,2), asymptote.
- S8: 1/3 – general increasing curve, but not through (1,0) and no asymptote.
- S9: 3/3 – correct curve, (1,0) and (½,−1), asymptote.
- S10: 3/3 – correct shape, (1,0), asymptote.
- S11: 3/3 – correct shape, (1,0), asymptote.
- S12: 3/3 – correct shape with key points and asymptote.
- S13: 0/3 – essentially a straight line; wrong intercept; no asymptote.
- S14: 3/3 – correct shape with several correct points and asymptote.
- S15: 1/3 – increasing curve but misses (1,0) and no asymptote.
- S16: 2/3 – shows (1,0) and asymptote; part of the graph drawn as a straight line.
- S17: 1/3 – piecewise/linear; has (1,0) but wrong shape and no asymptote.
- S18: 3/3 – correct curve, (1,0) implied via points (½,−1) and (2,1); asymptote clear.
- S19: 0/3 – two unrelated curves; wrong shape and intercept.
- S20: 3/3 – correct shape, (1,0) and (½,−1), asymptote.
- S21: 3/3 – correct shape, (1,0), asymptote.
- S22: 0/3 – wavy line; not a log graph and no features.
- S23: 0/3 – curve without axes/features; not gradable.
- S24: 0/3 – generic curve; lacks axes/intercept/asymptote.
- S25: 0/3 – no graph provided for grading (request ignored).
- S26: 0/3 – blank.

If you want any mark adjusted with tighter/looser interpretation of “asymptote shown,” say the word and I’ll revise.
