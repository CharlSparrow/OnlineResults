Here are marks using the memo (1 mark each for: correct increasing log shape, correct x‑intercept (1;0), vertical asymptote x=0).

- S1 — 1/3: x‑intercept correct; shape is piecewise linear and asymptote not indicated.
- S2 — 3/3: correct log shape, (1;0) shown, approaches y‑axis.
- S3 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote at x=0 indicated.
- S4 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S5 — 1/3: (1;0) shown, but drawn as straight line and no asymptote.
- S6 — 0/3: wrong graph for h⁻¹ (line), no (1;0), no asymptote.
- S7 — 3/3: correct shape, correct intercept, asymptote indicated.
- S8 — 0/3: looks exponential; (1;0) not shown; no asymptote.
- S9 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S10 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S11 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S12 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S13 — 0/3: straight line; (1;0) wrong; no asymptote.
- S14 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S15 — 0/3: exponential‑type sketch; no (1;0); no asymptote.
- S16 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S17 — 1/3: (1;0) marked, but graph is linear/piecewise; no asymptote.
- S18 — 2/3: correct log shape and asymptote; (1;0) not clearly indicated.
- S19 — 0/3: h⁻¹ drawn incorrectly; (1;0) missing; no asymptote at x=0.
- S20 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S21 — 3/3: correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote indicated.
- S22 — 0/3: arbitrary wavy curve; no intercept/asymptote.
- S23 — 0/3: no axes/criteria shown; cannot identify intercept or asymptote.
- S24 — 1/3: general log‑like shape but no axes; intercept/asymptote not shown.
- S25 — 0/3: no graph submitted to assess.
- S26 — 0/3: blank.

If you want me to adjust any borderline decisions (e.g., count an implied x‑intercept even if not labeled), say which ones and I’ll revise.
