Here's the grading of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo:

**Memo Criteria (3 marks total):**
1.  **Shape (vorm - stygende log funksie)**: 1 mark for the correct shape of an increasing logarithmic function.
2.  **x-intercept (x-afsnit)**: 1 mark for the x-intercept at (1, 0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot)**: 1 mark for a vertical asymptote at x = 0 (the y-axis).
