Here's a detailed grading of each student's graph based on the provided memo:

The memo outlines three criteria, each worth approximately 1 mark for a total of 3 marks:
1.  **Shape (vorm):** The graph must be an increasing logarithmic function. This means a curve that increases from left to right, bending towards a vertical asymptote.
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** The x-intercept must be correctly identified and/or labeled as (1,0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** A vertical asymptote must be shown along the y-axis (x=0), with the graph approaching it.

**Student S1:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The x-intercept visually appears to be at (1,0), but it is not explicitly labeled as (1,0). The student labels (0,1) (an incorrect y-intercept for this function) and (2,1). Since (1,0) is not identified/labeled as the x-intercept, this point is deducted. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 2/3**

**Student S2:**

**Student S4:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly labeled as (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)

*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 3/3**

**Student S6:**
*   **Shape:** The graph is a straight line, not a logarithmic curve. (0/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The x-intercept (1,0) is not labeled. Since the shape is incorrect, it does not represent the x-intercept of the required function. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** No vertical asymptote is shown; the line extends through the y-axis. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 0/3**

**Student S7:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly labeled as (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 3/3**

**Student S8:**
*   **Shape:** The curve starts at (0,0) and is somewhat linear, not the characteristic shape of a logarithmic function which approaches the y-axis asymptotically. (0/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The graph starts at (0,0) and (1,0) is not labeled as the x-intercept. For a standard logarithmic function, the x-intercept is (1,0) and it does not pass through (0,0). (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** No vertical asymptote is indicated; the graph starts at the origin. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 0/3**

**Student S9:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly labeled as (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 3/3**

**Student S10:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The x-intercept visually appears to be at (1,0), but it is not explicitly labeled as such. A point is labeled as (1,-2), which is incorrect for the x-intercept (or any point on log_b(x) for b>1 if (1/2,-1) is also on it). This deduction is for incorrect/missing label. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 2/3**

**Student S11:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)

**Student S12:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly labeled as (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 3/3**

**Student S13:**
*   **Shape:** The graph only shows a segment starting from (1,0) and moving upwards. It does not illustrate the full shape of a logarithmic function, especially its behavior as it approaches the asymptote. (0/1)
*   **X-intercept:** It starts at (1,0), implying the x-intercept, but it's not explicitly labeled as such. Only (2,1) and (4,2) are labeled. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** No vertical asymptote is shown, nor is the asymptotic behavior. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 0/3**

**Student S14:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly labeled as (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 3/3**

**Student S15:**
*   **Shape:** The graph appears to start from (0,0) and go right, which is incorrect for a standard logarithmic function (x=0 is an asymptote, not a point on the graph). The curve is also somewhat linear. (0/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The graph originates at (0,0), which is not the x-intercept for a log function. The point (1,0) is not marked. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** No vertical asymptote is indicated, as the graph begins at the origin. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 0/3**

*   **Grade: 3/3**

**Student S17:**
*   **Shape:** The graph is a straight line, not a logarithmic curve. (0/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The x-intercept visually appears to be at (1,0), but it is not labeled as such. As the shape is incorrect, it doesn't represent the x-intercept of the required function. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** No vertical asymptote is shown; the line extends through the y-axis. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 0/3**

**Student S18:**
*   **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The x-intercept visually appears to be at (1,0), but it is not explicitly labeled as (1,0). Other points like (1/2, -1), (2,1), (8,3) are labeled. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 2/3**

**Student S19:**
*   **Shape:** The curve labeled h⁻¹ is a correct increasing logarithmic function. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** The x-intercept (1,0) is not labeled for the h⁻¹ curve. Only (1/2, -1) is labeled for h⁻¹. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Correct vertical asymptote along the y-axis for h⁻¹. (1/1)
*   **Grade: 2/3** (Assuming only h⁻¹ is graded)

**Student S20:**
*   **Shape:** The graph is a straight line, not a logarithmic curve. (0/1)

*   **Grade: 0/3**

*   **Asymptote:** No asymptote is shown. (0/1)
*   **Grade: 0/3**

**Student S24:**
*   **Shape:** The graph is a curved line segment, but it does not represent the shape of an increasing logarithmic function (it looks more like a quadrant of a circle or a parabola opening right). (0/1)
