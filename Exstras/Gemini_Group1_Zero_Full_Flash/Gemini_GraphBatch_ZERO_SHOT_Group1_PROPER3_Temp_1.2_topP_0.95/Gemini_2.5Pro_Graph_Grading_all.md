Here is the grading for each student's graph based on the provided memo:

**Grading Criteria (3 marks total):**
1.  **Shape:** (1 mark) - `stygende log funksie` (increasing logarithmic function) - smooth curve, correct curvature.
2.  **X-intercept:** (1 mark) - `x-afsnit` at (1,0) (either explicitly labelled or clearly identifiable).
3.  **Asymptote:** (1 mark) - `assimptoot` - vertical asymptote at x=0 (y-axis) (either explicitly drawn or clearly implied by the curve's behavior).

**S1:**
*   **Shape:** Correct logarithmic curve. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Visually passes through (1,0), but not explicitly labelled. The label (0,1) is incorrect and confusing for a log function. (0/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Implied vertical asymptote at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
*   **Total: 2/3**

**S2:**
*   **Shape:** Correct logarithmic curve. (1/1)

*   **Total: 3/3**

**S3:**
*   **Shape:** Correct logarithmic curve. (1/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Labelled (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Implied vertical asymptote at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
*   **Total: 3/3**

**S4:**

*   **X-intercept:** Labelled (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** Explicit vertical asymptote drawn at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
*   **Total: 2/3**

**S8:**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect shape (linear segments, not a smooth curve; does not approach y-axis vertically but starts at approx. (0,0.5)). (0/1)
*   **X-intercept:** Visually appears to cross at (1,0). (1/1)
*   **Asymptote:** No vertical asymptote at x=0 (y-axis). (0/1)

*   **Total: 2/3**

**S11:**
