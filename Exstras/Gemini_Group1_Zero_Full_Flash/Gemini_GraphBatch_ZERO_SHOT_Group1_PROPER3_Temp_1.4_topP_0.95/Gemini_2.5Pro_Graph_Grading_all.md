Here's the grading of each student's graph (S1 to S26) based on the provided memo and criteria:

**Memo Criteria (3 marks total):**
1.  **Form:** The graph should be an increasing logarithmic function (stygende log funksie). (1 mark)
2.  **x-intercept:** The graph must pass through (1,0). (1 mark)
3.  **Asymptote:** The graph must have a vertical asymptote at x=0 (the y-axis). (1 mark)

---

**Student Grades:**

*   **S1:**
    1.  **Form:** Incorrect. The graph shows a y-intercept, implying it crosses the y-axis, which is not characteristic of a log function with a vertical asymptote at x=0. The x-intercept is also incorrect (visually around 0.5,0). (0/1)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Not (1,0). The visual x-intercept is approximately (0.5,0). (0/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Incorrect. The graph crosses the y-axis, therefore there is no vertical asymptote at x=0. (0/1)
    **Total S1: 0/3**

*   **S2:**
    1.  **Form:** Correct. (1/1)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Clearly marked as (1,0). (1/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Clearly implied at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
    **Total S2: 3/3**

*   **S3:**
    1.  **Form:** Correct. (1/1)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Clearly marked as (1,0). (1/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Clearly implied at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
    **Total S3: 3/3**

    1.  **Form:** Correct. (1/1)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Clearly marked as (1,0). (1/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Clearly implied at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)

    3.  **Asymptote:** Clearly implied at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
    **Total S5: 3/3**

*   **S6:**
    1.  **Form:** The labeled 'h^-1' curve segment has the general log shape but is incomplete and does not extend continuously through (1,0). The overall graph consists of two disconnected curves. (1/1 for the segment shape, but note incompleteness)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Not clearly marked as (1,0), and the curve does not explicitly pass through it. (0/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Implied at x=0 (y-axis) for the 'h^-1' segment. (1/1)
    **Total S6: 2/3**

*   **S7:**
    1.  **Form:** Correct. (1/1)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Clearly marked as (1,0). (1/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Clearly implied at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
    **Total S7: 3/3**

*   **S8:**
    1.  **Form:** Correct. It has the general shape of an increasing log function, though possibly shifted. (1/1)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Incorrect. The graph does not pass through (1,0). It appears to start from the y-axis (incorrectly for a standard log function without shift). (0/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Implied at x=0 (y-axis). (1/1)
    **Total S8: 2/3**

    **Total S12: 3/3**

*   **S13:**
    1.  **Form:** Incorrect. The graph looks like a square root function (half a parabola) starting at a point, not a logarithmic function with a vertical asymptote. (0/1)
    2.  **x-intercept:** Not (1,0). The curve starts at approximately (0.5,0). (0/1)
    3.  **Asymptote:** Incorrect. The curve starts at the x-axis, no vertical asymptote. (0/1)
    **Total S13: 0/3**

    **Total S18: 3/3**

*   **S19:**
    1.  **Form:** The labeled 'h^-1' curve has a general log shape but seems to lose its continuous curvature and correct increasing form as it approaches and crosses the x-axis. (0/1)
