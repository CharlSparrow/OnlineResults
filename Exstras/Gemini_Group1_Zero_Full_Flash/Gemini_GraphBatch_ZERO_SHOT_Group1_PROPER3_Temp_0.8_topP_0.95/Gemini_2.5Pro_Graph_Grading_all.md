Here's the grading of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo:

The memo outlines three criteria for grading, each likely worth 1 mark, for a total of 3 marks:
1.  **Shape (vorm):** The graph must be an increasing logarithmic function (a curve that increases from left to right, concave down, and approaches the y-axis).
2.  **x-intercept (x-afsnit):** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** The graph must have a vertical asymptote at x = 0 (the y-axis), which means the curve approaches the y-axis but never touches or crosses it.

**Student S1:**
*   **Shape:** Correct. (1 mark)

*   **Grade: 2/3**
