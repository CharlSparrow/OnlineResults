Here's the grading of each student's graph based on the provided memo. The memo criteria are:
1.  **Shape (stygende log funksie):** Correct shape of an increasing logarithmic function (concave down, increasing, approaches y-axis as asymptote, extends to positive x).
2.  **x-afsnit (x-intercept):** Clearly shows or labels the x-intercept at (1,0).
3.  **Assimpoot (Asymptote):** Clearly shows the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical asymptote.

Each criterion is worth 1 point, for a total of 3 points.

**Student Grades:**

*   **S1:**
    *   Shape: Incorrect. The graph passes through (0,1) instead of approaching the y-axis asymptotically.
    *   x-intercept: Graph passes through (1,0), but the incorrect point (0,1) is labeled on the y-axis.
    *   Asymptote: Incorrect. The graph crosses the y-axis, not approaches it.
    *   **Grade: 0/3**

*   **S2:**
    *   Shape: Correct.
    *   x-intercept: Labeled (1,0) correctly.

    *   Asymptote: Correctly shows y-axis as asymptote.
    *   **Grade: 3/3**

*   **S6:**
    *   Shape: Incorrect. This is not a logarithmic function; it appears to be two separate curves or a distorted hyperbola, crossing the y-axis.

    *   **Grade: 0/3**

    *   **Grade: 3/3**

*   **S8:**
    *   Shape: Incorrect. The graph is piecewise linear (straight line segments) and starts at (0,0), which is incorrect for a logarithmic function.
    *   x-intercept: Incorrect. Starts at (0,0), not passing through (1,0) as an x-intercept.
    *   Asymptote: Incorrect. Passes through (0,0), so no vertical asymptote at x=0.

    *   **Grade: 0/3**

*   **S15:**
    *   Shape: Incorrect. The graph starts at (0,0) instead of approaching the y-axis asymptotically.
    *   x-intercept: Incorrect. Starts at (0,0), not passing through (1,0) as an x-intercept.

    *   Shape: Correct.
    *   x-intercept: Clearly passes through (1,0) based on the grid, even if not explicitly labeled.
    *   Asymptote: Correctly shows y-axis as asymptote.
    *   **Grade: 3/3**

*   **S19:**
    *   Shape: Incorrect. The graph for h^-1 appears to start at x=0 or cross the y-axis, and the curve is not smooth, flattening out.
    *   x-intercept: The graph passes through (1,0) based on the grid.
    *   Asymptote: Incorrect. The graph touches/crosses the y-axis, not approaches it asymptotically.

    *   Asymptote: Not present.
    *   **Grade: 0/3**

*   **S24:**

    *   Asymptote: Not present.
    *   **Grade: 0/3**

*   **S25:**
