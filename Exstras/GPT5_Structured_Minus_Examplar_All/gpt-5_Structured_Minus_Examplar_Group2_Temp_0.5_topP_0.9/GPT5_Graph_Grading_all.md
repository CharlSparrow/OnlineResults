Here are the marks per student (out of 3), using the memo’s three criteria: shape, x‑intercept at (1;0), and asymptote respected (no crossing of y‑axis).

- S1: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S2: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S3: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S4: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S5: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S6: 1/3 – shape only; no (1;0); graph crosses y‑axis.
- S7: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S8: 2/3 – shape ok, no (1;0); asymptote respected.
- S9: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S10: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S11: 2/3 – shape and (1;0) ok; crosses y‑axis (asymptote not respected).
- S12: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S13: 2/3 – shape ok, no (1;0); asymptote respected.
- S14: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S15: 2/3 – shape ok, no (1;0); asymptote respected.
- S16: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S17: 2/3 – shape ok, no (1;0); asymptote respected.
- S18: 2/3 – shape ok, no (1;0); asymptote respected.
- S19: 1/3 – shape only; no (1;0); crosses y‑axis.
- S20: 2/3 – shape ok, (1;0) not clearly indicated; asymptote respected.
- S21: 3/3 – shape ok, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.
- S22: 0/3 – wrong/unclear shape, no (1;0), crosses y‑axis.
- S23: 0/3 – no axes/intercept/asymptote evidenced.
- S24: 0/3 – no axes/intercept/asymptote evidenced.
- S25: 0/3 – no graph to assess.
- S26: 0/3 – blank.
