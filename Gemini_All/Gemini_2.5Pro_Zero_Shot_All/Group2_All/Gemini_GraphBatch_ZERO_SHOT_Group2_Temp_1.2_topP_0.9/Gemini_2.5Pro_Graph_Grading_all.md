Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo.

**Memo Criteria (Total 3 Marks):**
1.  **Shape (1 mark):** Correct increasing, concave-down logarithmic curve.
2.  **X-intercept (1 mark):** The graph must clearly pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Asymptote (1 mark):** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0).
