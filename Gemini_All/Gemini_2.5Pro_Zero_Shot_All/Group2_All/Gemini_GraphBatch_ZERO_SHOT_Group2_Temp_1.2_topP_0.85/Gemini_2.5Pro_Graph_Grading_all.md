Based on the provided memo, here are the grades for each of the 26 student graphs.

**Marking Memo Criteria (Total: 3 Marks)**
*   **1 Mark:** Correct shape (increasing logarithmic function, concave down).
*   **1 Mark:** Correct x-intercept at (1, 0).
*   **1 Mark:** Correct vertical asymptote (the y-axis, x=0).
