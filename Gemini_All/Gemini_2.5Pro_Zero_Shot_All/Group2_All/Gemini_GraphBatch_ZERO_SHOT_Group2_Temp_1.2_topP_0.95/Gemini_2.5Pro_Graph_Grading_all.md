Based on the provided memo, the graphs should be graded out of 3 marks according to the following criteria:

1.  **Shape:** Correct increasing logarithmic function shape (1 mark).
2.  **X-intercept:** The graph must correctly pass through the point (1, 0) (1 mark).
3.  **Asymptote:** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0) (1 mark).

Here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs:

**S1:** **1/3**
- Shape: Incorrect (piecewise linear).
- X-intercept: Correct (passes through (1, 0)).
- Asymptote: Incorrect (no clear asymptote).
