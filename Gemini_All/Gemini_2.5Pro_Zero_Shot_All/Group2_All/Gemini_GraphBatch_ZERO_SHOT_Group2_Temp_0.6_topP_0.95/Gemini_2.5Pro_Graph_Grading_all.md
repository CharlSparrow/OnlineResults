Based on the provided memo, the graphs are graded out of 3 marks. The criteria are:

1.  **Shape (vorm):** The graph must have the correct shape of an increasing logarithmic function (concave down). (1 mark)
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0). (1 mark)
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0). (1 mark)
