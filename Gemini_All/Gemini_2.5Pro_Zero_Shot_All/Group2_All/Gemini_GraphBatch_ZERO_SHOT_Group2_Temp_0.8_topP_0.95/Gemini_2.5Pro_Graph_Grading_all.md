Based on the provided memo, the graphs are graded out of 3 marks. The criteria are:

1.  **Shape (1 mark):** The graph must have the correct shape of an increasing logarithmic function (curving upwards and to the right, concave down).
2.  **X-intercept (1 mark):** The graph must pass through the x-axis at the point (1, 0).
3.  **Asymptote (1 mark):** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at x=0 (the y-axis), with the curve approaching it as y goes to negative infinity.

Here is the grading for each of the 26 students:

*   **S1:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape - piecewise linear. Correct x-intercept. No asymptote.)
*   **S2:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S3:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S4:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S5:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S6:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape - straight line. Correct x-intercept. No asymptote.)
*   **S7:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S8:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - looks exponential/concave up. Incorrect intercept. No vertical asymptote.)
*   **S9:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S10:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S11:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S12:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S13:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - straight line. Incorrect intercept. No asymptote.)
*   **S14:** **3/3** (Excellent graph. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote with multiple accurate points.)
*   **S15:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - looks exponential/concave up. Incorrect intercept. No vertical asymptote.)
*   **S16:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S17:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape - straight line. Correct x-intercept. No asymptote.)
*   **S18:** **2/3** (Correct shape and asymptote, but the x-intercept is clearly not at (1, 0).)
*   **S19:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - concave up. Incorrect intercept. No asymptote.)
*   **S20:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S21:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.)
*   **S22:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph - wavy horizontal line.)
*   **S23:** **0/3** (Incomplete - no axes.)
*   **S24:** **0/3** (Incorrect orientation/shape.)
*   **S25:** **0/3** (No graph provided, only text.)
*   **S26:** **0/3** (Blank.)
