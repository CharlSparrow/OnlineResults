Based on the provided memo, the graph of the inverse function is worth 3 marks. The marks are awarded for the following criteria:
1.  **Correct Shape:** An increasing logarithmic function (concave down).
2.  **X-intercept:** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Asymptote:** The graph must have a vertical asymptote at x=0 (the y-axis).

Here are the grades for each of the 26 students:

**S1:** **1/3** - The x-intercept is correct, but the shape is a series of straight lines, not a logarithmic curve. No vertical asymptote.
**S2:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S3:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S4:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S5:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S6:** **0/3** - Incorrect graphs. Neither graph shown is the correct function.
**S7:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S8:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (exponential, not logarithmic). No correct intercept or asymptote.
**S9:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S10:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S11:** **1/3** - The x-intercept is correct, but the shape is a straight line, and there is no vertical asymptote.
**S12:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S13:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (piecewise linear), incorrect x-intercept, and no asymptote.
**S14:** **3/3** - Excellent graph. Correct shape, x-intercept, asymptote, and several correctly plotted points.
**S15:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (exponential, not logarithmic). Incorrect intercept and no vertical asymptote.
**S16:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S17:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (straight line), incorrect x-intercept, and no asymptote.
**S18:** **2/3** - The shape and vertical asymptote are correct, but the x-intercept is incorrectly placed above (1, 0).
**S19:** **1/3** - The shape is roughly correct, but there is no x-intercept at (1, 0) and no vertical asymptote at x=0.
**S20:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
**S21:** **3/3** - Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote. (Note: The additional point (1/2, 1) is plotted incorrectly, but the three grading criteria are met).
**S22:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape. Does not resemble a logarithmic function.
**S23:** **0/3** - No axes are drawn, making it impossible to grade the intercept or asymptote. The shape is just a simple curve.
**S24:** **1/3** - The shape is correct, but without axes, the x-intercept and asymptote cannot be confirmed.
**S25:** **0/3** - No graph is drawn. Instructions to the grader do not replace the required answer.
**S26:** **0/3** - The page is blank.
