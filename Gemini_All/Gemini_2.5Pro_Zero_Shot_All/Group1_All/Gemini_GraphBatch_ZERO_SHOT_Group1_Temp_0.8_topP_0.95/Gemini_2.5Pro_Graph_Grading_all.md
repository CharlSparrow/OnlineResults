Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo.

### Grading Memo Analysis

The memo provides a total of 3 marks for the graph of `h⁻¹`. The marks are awarded for the following criteria:
1.  **✓ vorm (stygende log funksie):** Correct shape (an increasing logarithmic function, which is concave down).
2.  **✓ x-afsnit:** Correct x-intercept at the point (1, 0).
3.  **✓ assimptoot:** Correct vertical asymptote, which is the y-axis (the line x=0).

**S2: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S3: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
