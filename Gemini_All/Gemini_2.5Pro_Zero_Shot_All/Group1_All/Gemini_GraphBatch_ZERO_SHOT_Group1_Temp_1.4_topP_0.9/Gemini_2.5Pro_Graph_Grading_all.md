Of course. Here is the grading of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo.

### Grading Memo Analysis

The memo provides a graph of the function h⁻¹ and outlines the criteria for full marks, which total 3. The marks are awarded as follows:

1.  **✓ vorm (stygende log funksie):** 1 mark for the correct shape – an increasing logarithmic function that is concave down.
2.  **✓ x-afsnit:** 1 mark for the correct x-intercept at the point **(1, 0)**.
3.  **✓ assimptoot:** 1 mark for the correct vertical asymptote, which is the y-axis (the line x=0). The graph must approach the y-axis as y approaches negative infinity but not touch or cross it.

### Student Grades (X/3)

Here are the grades for each student's graph:

**S1: 0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph has been shifted vertically.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The graph shows a y-intercept at (0, 1), not an x-intercept at (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect due to the shift.

**S2: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S3: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis. Also includes the point (1/2, -1).

**S4: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S5: 2/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph is not concave down; it has an inflection point, resembling a cubic function.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S6: 0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. This appears to be a hyperbola, not a logarithmic function.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect.
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. A horizontal asymptote is shown instead of a vertical one.

**S7: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S8: 0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph is composed of straight-line segments.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The graph does not intersect the x-axis.
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. There is no asymptotic behavior shown.

**S9: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S10: 2/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The x-intercept is clearly between 0 and 1, not at (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S11: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S12: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S13: 1/3**
*   **Shape:** The curvature is generally correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The graph starts after x=1 and does not show the intercept.
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. No asymptotic behavior is shown as the graph starts at a point.

**S14: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis. An excellent, well-plotted graph.

**S15: 0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph is concave up, resembling a square root function.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The intercept is at (0, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. There is no vertical asymptote.

**S16: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S17: 0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. This is a straight line.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect.
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect.

**S18: 2/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The intercept is not at (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S19: 2/3**
*   (Grading the graph labeled h⁻¹)
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The graph does not pass through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S20: 1/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph appears to be made of two straight lines.
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect.
*   **Asymptote:** The graph correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S21: 3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correctly approaches the y-axis.

**S22: 0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. A wavy line is drawn.
*   **X-intercept:** N/A.
*   **Asymptote:** N/A.

**S23: 0/3**
*   No axes are drawn, making it impossible to grade key features. The shape resembles a parabola, which is incorrect.

**S24: 1/3**
*   **Shape:** The shape is generally correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Cannot be determined as no axes are drawn.
*   **Asymptote:** Cannot be determined as no axes are drawn.

**S25: 0/3**
*   This is not a graph. No marks awarded.

**S26: 0/3**
*   Blank page. No attempt.
