Of course. I will grade the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo.

The memo indicates that a total of 3 marks can be awarded for the graph of h⁻¹. The marks are allocated as follows:

1.  **✓ vorm (stygende log funksie):** 1 mark for the correct shape (an increasing logarithmic function, which is concave down).
2.  **✓ x-afsnit:** 1 mark for the correct x-intercept at the point (1, 0).
3.  **✓ assimptoot:** 1 mark for correctly showing the y-axis (the line x=0) as a vertical asymptote.

Here is the grading for each student:

*   **S1:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (looks like a square root function), incorrect intercept at (0,1), no clear asymptote.
*   **S2:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S3:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S4:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S5:** **3/3** - The shape is slightly wobbly but acceptable. Correct x-intercept and asymptote.
*   **S6:** **0/3** - Completely incorrect shape (looks like a hyperbola).
*   **S7:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S8:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (piecewise linear), no x-intercept, no asymptote.
*   **S9:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S10:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S11:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S12:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S13:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (concave up), no clear intercept at (1,0), no vertical asymptote.
*   **S14:** **3/3** - Excellent graph. Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S15:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (starts at origin, concave up), incorrect x-intercept at (0,0), no vertical asymptote.
*   **S16:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S17:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (drawn as a straight line).
*   **S18:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (piecewise linear), incorrect x-intercept, though the asymptote is implied. The fundamental errors outweigh the single correct feature.
*   **S19:** **2/3** - Correct shape and correct asymptote are shown for h⁻¹. However, the x-intercept is incorrect (it appears to be less than 1).
*   **S20:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (drawn as a straight line).
*   **S21:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct asymptote.
*   **S22:** **0/3** - No valid graph drawn.
*   **S23:** **0/3** - Incomplete answer. A curve is drawn without axes, so it's impossible to grade intercepts or asymptotes.
*   **S24:** **1/3** - The shape is correct. However, without axes, no marks can be given for the intercept or asymptote.
*   **S25:** **0/3** - The student wrote a message instead of drawing the graph. No marks awarded.
*   **S26:** **0/3** - Blank. No attempt made.
