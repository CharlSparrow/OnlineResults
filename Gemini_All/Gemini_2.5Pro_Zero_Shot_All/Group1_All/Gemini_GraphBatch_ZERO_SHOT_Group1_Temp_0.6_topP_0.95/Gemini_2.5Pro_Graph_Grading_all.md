Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo.

**Memo Grading Criteria (Total: 3 Marks)**
1.  **Shape (1 mark):** The graph must have the correct shape of an increasing logarithmic function (concave down, approaching a vertical asymptote).
2.  **X-intercept (1 mark):** The graph must clearly pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Asymptote (1 mark):** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at x=0 (the y-axis).
