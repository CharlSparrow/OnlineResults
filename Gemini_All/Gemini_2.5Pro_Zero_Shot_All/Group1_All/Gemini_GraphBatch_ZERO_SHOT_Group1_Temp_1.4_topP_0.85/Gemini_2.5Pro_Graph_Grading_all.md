Based on the provided memo, the graphs are graded out of 3 marks. The criteria are:

1.  **Shape (Vorm):** The graph must have the correct shape of an increasing logarithmic function (concave down). (1 mark)
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0). (1 mark)
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** The graph must show the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical asymptote. (1 mark)

Here is the grading for each student:

*   **S1:** **1/3** (Correct shape, but incorrect x-intercept at (0,1)).
*   **S2:** **3/3** (All criteria met: correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **S3:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S4:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S5:** **2/3** (Correct x-intercept and asymptote, but the shape is too linear, not concave down).
*   **S6:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape; not a logarithmic function).
*   **S7:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S8:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - piecewise linear, no asymptote, incorrect start point).
*   **S9:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S10:** **2/3** (Correct shape and asymptote, but the x-intercept is incorrect).
*   **S11:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S12:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S13:** **0/3** (Incomplete graph; missing the key features of the x-intercept and asymptote).
*   **S14:** **3/3** (Excellent graph, all criteria clearly met).
*   **S15:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - concave up, starts at origin, incorrect intercept).
*   **S16:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S17:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - a straight line).
*   **S18:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S19:** **1/3** (Shape is generally correct, but the x-intercept and position of the asymptote are incorrect).
*   **S20:** **2/3** (Correct x-intercept and asymptote, but the shape is a straight line).
*   **S21:** **3/3** (All criteria met).
*   **S22:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph).
*   **S23:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape and no axes).
*   **S24:** **1/3** (Correct shape, but no axes to verify the intercept or asymptote).
*   **S25:** **0/3** (No graph provided, only text).
*   **S26:** **0/3** (Blank, no attempt).
