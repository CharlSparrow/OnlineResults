Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo.

### Grading Memo Breakdown

The memo provides three criteria for a total of 3 marks:
1.  **✓ vorm (stygende log funksie):** Correct shape (an increasing logarithmic function). The curve must be increasing and concave down.
2.  **✓ x-afsnit:** Correct x-intercept at the point (1, 0).
3.  **✓ assimptoot:** Correct asymptote. The graph must approach the y-axis (x=0) as y approaches negative infinity, without touching or crossing it.

### Student Grades (X/3)

*   **S1:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (looks like a square root function), incorrect intercept (shows y-intercept at (0,1)), no vertical asymptote.
*   **S2:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S3:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S4:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S5:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote. The curve is a bit straight but acceptable.
*   **S6:** **0/3** - Completely incorrect shape (looks like a hyperbola), incorrect intercepts, and incorrect asymptote.
*   **S7:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S8:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (piecewise linear, not a curve), incorrect intercept, no asymptote.
*   **S9:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S10:** **2/3** - Correct shape and asymptote, but the x-intercept is incorrectly placed at (1/2, 0) instead of (1, 0).
*   **S11:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S12:** **3/3** - Excellent graph. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **S13:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (square root function), no clear intercept at (1,0), and no asymptote (has a starting point).
*   **S14:** **3/3** - Excellent graph. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **S15:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (square root function), incorrect intercept (starts at origin), no asymptote.
*   **S16:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S17:** **1/3** - Incorrect shape (straight line) and no asymptote. Gets one mark for the correct x-intercept at (1, 0).
*   **S18:** **2/3** - Correct shape and asymptote, but the x-intercept is incorrect (passes through the x-axis at x < 1).
*   **S19:** **2/3** - The graph labeled `h⁻¹` has the correct shape and asymptote. However, the x-intercept is incorrect (passes through the origin).
*   **S20:** **1/3** - Incorrect shape (straight line) and no asymptote. Gets one mark for the correct x-intercept.
*   **S21:** **3/3** - Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
*   **S22:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape. Does not resemble a log function.
*   **S23:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape (looks like a parabola). No axes or points are defined.
*   **S24:** **0/3** - Incorrect shape. No axes or points are defined.
*   **S25:** **0/3** - No graph was drawn. Instructions to the grader are not a valid answer.
*   **S26:** **0/3** - Blank paper. No attempt made.
