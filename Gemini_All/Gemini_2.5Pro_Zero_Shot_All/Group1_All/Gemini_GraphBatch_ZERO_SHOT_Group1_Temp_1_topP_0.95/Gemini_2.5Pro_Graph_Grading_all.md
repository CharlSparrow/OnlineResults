Of course. Here is a grading of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum.

### Grading Memo Analysis

The memo provides a marking scheme for a total of 3 marks, based on three key features of the graph of h⁻¹:

1.  **✓ vorm (stygende log funksie):** 1 mark for the correct shape – an increasing logarithmic function which is concave down.
2.  **✓ x-afsnit:** 1 mark for the correct x-intercept at the point **(1, 0)**.
3.  **✓ assimptoot:** 1 mark for showing a vertical asymptote at **x = 0** (the y-axis). The graph must approach the y-axis but not touch or cross it.

### Student Grades

Here is the breakdown of the marks for each student:

**S1:** **0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The shape is concave up (like a square root function).
*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. The intercept is at (0, 1).
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. No vertical asymptote at x=0.

**S2:** **3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correct, passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correct, approaches the y-axis.

**S3:** **3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correct, passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correct, approaches the y-axis.

**S4:** **3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correct, passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correct, approaches the y-axis.

**S5:** **1/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. The graph has an inflection point and is not consistently concave down.
*   **X-intercept:** Correct, passes through (1, 0).

*   **X-intercept:** Incorrect. Intercept is at (0, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Incorrect. No asymptote shown.

**S16:** **3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correct, passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correct, approaches the y-axis.

**S21:** **3/3**
*   **Shape:** Correct.
*   **X-intercept:** Correct, passes through (1, 0).
*   **Asymptote:** Correct, approaches the y-axis.

**S22:** **0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. This is a wave function. Not a serious attempt.

**S23:** **0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. Does not represent a function and is missing axes. Incomplete.

**S24:** **0/3**
*   **Shape:** Incorrect. Vague shape missing axes. Incomplete.
