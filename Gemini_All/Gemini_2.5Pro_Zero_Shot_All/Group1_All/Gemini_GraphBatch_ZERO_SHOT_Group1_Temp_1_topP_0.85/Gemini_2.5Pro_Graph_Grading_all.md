Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memo.

### Grading Memo Analysis

The memo indicates that 3 marks are available for the graph of `h⁻¹`. The marks are awarded for the following criteria:
1.  **Shape (vorm):** The graph must be an increasing logarithmic function (concave down).
2.  **x-intercept (x-afsnit):** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at x=0 (the y-axis), meaning it approaches the y-axis but does not touch or cross it.

### Student Grades

| Student | Shape (1 mark) | x-intercept (1 mark) | Asymptote (1 mark) | **Total Score** | Comments |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **S1** | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1/3** | Incorrect x-intercept at (0,1). The graph starts on the y-axis instead of approaching it as an asymptote. |
| **S2** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S3** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Excellent. All criteria met, including the point (1/2, -1). |
| **S4** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S5** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Excellent. All criteria met, including the point (1/2, -1). |
| **S6** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The shape is completely incorrect; it looks like a cubic function. |
| **S7** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S8** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (piecewise linear). Does not show asymptotic behavior. |
| **S9** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Excellent. All criteria met, including the point (1/2, -1). |
| **S10** | 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape and asymptote are correct, but the x-intercept is incorrect (appears to be at x=1/2). |
| **S11** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Excellent. All criteria met, including the point (1/2, -1). |
| **S12** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Excellent. All criteria met, and multiple correct points are plotted. |
| **S13** | 0 | 1 | 0 | **1/3** | The x-intercept is correct, but the shape is a square root function, and there is no vertical asymptote. |
| **S14** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Excellent. All criteria met, and multiple correct points are plotted, showing a strong understanding. |
| **S15** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (square root) and starts from the origin. |
| **S16** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S17** | 0 | 1 | 0 | **1/3** | The x-intercept is correct, but the graph is a straight line, not a logarithmic curve. |
| **S18** | 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape and asymptote are correct, but the x-intercept is incorrect. The graph is shifted. |
| **S19** | 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | Graded the `h⁻¹` graph. Shape and asymptote are correct, but the x-intercept is incorrect. |
| **S20** | 0 | 1 | 0 | **1/3** | The x-intercept is correct, but the graph is a straight line. |
| **S21** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Excellent. All criteria met, including the point (1/2, -1). |
| **S22** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect graph (wavy horizontal line). |
| **S23** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape and no axes provided. |
| **S24** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Shape is similar but incorrectly oriented. No axes provided. |
| **S25** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | No graph provided. An attempt to get marks without doing the work. |
| **S26** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Blank submission. |
