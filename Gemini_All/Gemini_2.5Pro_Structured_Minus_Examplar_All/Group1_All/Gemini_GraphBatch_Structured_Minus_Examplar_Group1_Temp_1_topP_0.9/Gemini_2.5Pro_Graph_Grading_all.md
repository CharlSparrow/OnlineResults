Based on the provided memorandum, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs:

**Memorandum Criteria:**
*   **Mark 1 (Shape):** The graph has the general shape of an increasing logarithmic function (concave down, pointing up and to the right).
*   **Mark 2 (X-intercept):** The graph correctly identifies the x-intercept at (1;0).
*   **Mark 3 (Asymptote):** The graph respects the y-axis as a vertical asymptote and does not cross it.
