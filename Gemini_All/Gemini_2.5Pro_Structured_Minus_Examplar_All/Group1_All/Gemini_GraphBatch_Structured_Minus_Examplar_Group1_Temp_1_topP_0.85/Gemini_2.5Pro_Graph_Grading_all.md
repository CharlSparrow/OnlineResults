Based on the provided memorandum, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs:

**Memorandum Criteria:**
1.  **Shape (Vorm):** 1 mark for a correctly shaped, increasing logarithmic graph.
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** 1 mark for correctly indicating the x-intercept at (1;0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** 1 mark for the graph not crossing the y-axis (x=0).
