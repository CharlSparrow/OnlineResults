Based on the provided memorandum, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs. Each student is graded out of 3 marks.

**Criteria:**
*   **Shape (1 mark):** Correct logarithmic shape (increasing and concave down).
*   **X-intercept (1 mark):** Correctly marked at (1;0).
*   **Asymptote (1 mark):** The graph does not cross the y-axis.
