Based on the provided memorandum, here are the grades for each of the 26 student graphs.

Each student is graded out of 3, with one mark for each of the following criteria:
*   **Shape:** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept:** Correctly identified at (1;0).
*   **Asymptote:** Graph correctly does not cross the y-axis.
