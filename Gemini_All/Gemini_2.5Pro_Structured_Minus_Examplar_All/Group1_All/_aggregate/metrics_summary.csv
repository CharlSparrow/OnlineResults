The memorandum defines three marks that can be obtained, making the maximum mark three:
A mark for the shape (vorm) of the graph being similar to that of a logarithmic graph with base two. The shape of the logarithmic graph is generally considered correct should the part of the graph above the x-axis is roughly pointing to the right.
A mark for correctly writing out the co-ordinate of the intersection between the logarithmic graph and the x-axis (x-afsnit). The correct co-ordinate is (1;0), it is also correct if the student draws a dot where the logarithmic graph intersects the x-axis and then writes a ""1"" nearby.
A mark for the students graph correctly respecting the asymptote (assimptoot), thus meaning that the students graph does not cross y-axis. Should there be ambiguity the student should be awarded the mark, meaning if it comes very close but does not actually cross the y-axis they still get the mark, a mark here should only be deducted if it appears that the student truely intentionally crossed the y-axis since this is a graph drawn by hand pencil artifacts etc likely make it look more wrong than it is.",Structured-minus-exemplar,Gemini 2.5 Pro,Group1,1.0,,
