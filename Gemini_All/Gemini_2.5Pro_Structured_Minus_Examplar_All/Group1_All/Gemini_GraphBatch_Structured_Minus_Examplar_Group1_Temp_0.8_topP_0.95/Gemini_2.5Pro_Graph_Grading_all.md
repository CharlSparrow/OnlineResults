Based on the provided memorandum, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs:

**Memorandum Criteria:**
1.  **Shape (Vorm):** Correct logarithmic shape (increasing, concave down). (1 mark)
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** Correctly marked at (1;0) or with a dot and a "1". (1 mark)
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** Graph does not cross the y-axis (x=0). (1 mark)

| Student | Shape (1) | X-intercept (1) | Asymptote (1) | **Total (X/3)** | Justification |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **S1** | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1/3** | Correct shape. Incorrect x-intercept shown at (0,1). Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S2** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S3** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S4** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S5** | 1 | 1 | 0 | **2/3** | Correct shape and x-intercept. Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S6** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape. No correct intercept shown. Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S7** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S8** | 0 | 0 | 1 | **1/3** | Incorrect shape (not a smooth curve). X-intercept is missing. Respects the asymptote. |
| **S9** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S10** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S11** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S12** | 1 | 1 | 0 | **2/3** | Correct shape and x-intercept. Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S13** | 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | Shape is acceptable and respects the asymptote. X-intercept is incorrect (graph starts at x=1 but above the axis). |
| **S14** | 0 | 1 | 1 | **2/3** | Incorrect shape (piecewise linear). Correct x-intercept and respects the asymptote. |
| **S15** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (starts at origin, wrong concavity). Incorrect intercept. Does not respect the asymptote. |
| **S16** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S17** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (straight line). Incorrect intercept. Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S18** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (piecewise linear). Incorrect intercept. Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S19** | 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | Correct shape and respects the asymptote. X-intercept is not clearly marked at (1,0). |
| **S20** | 0 | 1 | 0 | **1/3** | Incorrect shape (straight line). Correct x-intercept. Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S21** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | All criteria met. |
| **S22** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (wavy line). No correct intercept. Graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S23** | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1/3** | Correct shape, but no axes are drawn, so the intercept and asymptote cannot be graded. |
| **S24** | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1/3** | Correct shape, but no axes are drawn, so the intercept and asymptote cannot be graded. |
| **S25** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | No graph is drawn. The student's instruction is disregarded as per the grading task. |
| **S26** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | No graph is drawn. |
