Of course. Here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum.

### Grading Criteria Summary:

*   **1 Mark: Shape (Vorm):** The graph must have the characteristic increasing, concave-down curve of a logarithmic function (y = log₂(x)). Straight lines or exponential shapes are incorrect.
*   **1 Mark: X-intercept (x-afsnit):** The graph must pass through the x-axis at x=1, and this point must be indicated either with the coordinate (1;0) or a dot with a "1" nearby.
*   **1 Mark: Asymptote (Assimptoot):** The graph must not cross the y-axis. The mark is awarded with the benefit of the doubt unless the graph clearly and intentionally crosses into the negative x-values.
