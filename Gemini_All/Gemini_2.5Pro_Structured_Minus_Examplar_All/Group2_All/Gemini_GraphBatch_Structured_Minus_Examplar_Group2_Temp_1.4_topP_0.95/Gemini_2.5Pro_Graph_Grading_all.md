Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum.

**Grading Criteria:**
1.  **Shape (Vorm):** 1 mark for a shape similar to an increasing logarithmic graph (curved, concave down).
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** 1 mark for correctly indicating the intercept at (1;0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** 1 mark for the graph not crossing the y-axis.

### **Grading Results**
