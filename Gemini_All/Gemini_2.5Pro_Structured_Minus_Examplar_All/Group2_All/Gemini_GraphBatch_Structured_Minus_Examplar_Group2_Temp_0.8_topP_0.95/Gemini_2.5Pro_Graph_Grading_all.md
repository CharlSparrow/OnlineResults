Of course. Here is the grading of the 26 student graphs based on the memorandum provided.

### Grading Breakdown

Each student's graph is assessed against the three criteria:
1.  **Shape (Vorm):** 1 mark for a correct, increasing logarithmic curve.
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** 1 mark for correctly identifying the intercept at (1,0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** 1 mark for respecting the y-axis as an asymptote.
