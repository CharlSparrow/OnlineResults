Based on the provided memorandum, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs. Each student is graded out of a maximum of 3 marks.

**Grading Criteria:**
1.  **Shape:** 1 mark for a curve resembling an increasing logarithmic function.
2.  **X-intercept:** 1 mark for correctly indicating the x-intercept at (1;0).
3.  **Asymptote:** 1 mark for the graph not crossing the y-axis (asymptote at x=0).
