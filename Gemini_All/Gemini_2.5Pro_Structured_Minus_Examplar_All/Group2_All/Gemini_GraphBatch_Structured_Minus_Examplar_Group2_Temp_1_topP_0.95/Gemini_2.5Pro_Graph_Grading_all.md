Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum.

### Grading Memorandum Criteria:
*   **Mark 1 (Shape/Vorm):** The graph must have the characteristic shape of an increasing logarithmic function (curving to the right, concave down).
*   **Mark 2 (X-intercept/x-afsnit):** The graph must correctly show the x-intercept at (1,0), either by writing the coordinate or by marking a point at x=1 on the axis with a "1" nearby.
*   **Mark 3 (Asymptote/assimptoot):** The graph must approach the y-axis (x=0) but not cross it. Benefit of the doubt is given for hand-drawn graphs.
