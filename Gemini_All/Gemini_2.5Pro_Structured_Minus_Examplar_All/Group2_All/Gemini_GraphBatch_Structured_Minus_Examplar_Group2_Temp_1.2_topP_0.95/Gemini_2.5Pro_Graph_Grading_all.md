Of course. Here is the grading for the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum.

**Grading Criteria Recap:**
1.  **Shape (1 Mark):** Correct logarithmic curve (increasing, concave down).
2.  **X-intercept (1 Mark):** Correctly indicated at (1;0), either with coordinates or a dot and a "1".
3.  **Asymptote (1 Mark):** Graph approaches but does not cross the y-axis (x=0). Benefit of the doubt is given.

### **Individual Student Grades**

**S1: 1/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph is a straight line, not a logarithmic curve.
*   **X-intercept (1/1):** Correct. The graph passes through (1;0).

**S2: 3/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (1/1):** Correctly labeled at (1;0).

**S3: 3/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (1/1):** Correctly labeled at (1;0).
*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. The graph approaches the y-axis without crossing.

**S4: 3/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (1/1):** Correctly labeled at (1;0).

*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. The graph approaches the y-axis without crossing.

**S6: 0/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. The student has drawn a hyperbola, not a logarithmic graph.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph drawn does not correctly represent the required function or its intercept.
*   **Asymptote (0/1):** Incorrect. While the shape respects a vertical asymptote, the entire graph is wrong.

**S7: 3/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.

*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. The graph approaches the y-axis without crossing.

**S8: 0/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. This is the shape of an exponential graph (concave up), not a logarithmic graph (concave down).
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph does not intersect the x-axis at (1;0).
*   **Asymptote (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph respects the x-axis as a horizontal asymptote, which is wrong for this function.

*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. The graph approaches the y-axis without crossing.

**S12: 3/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (1/1):** Correct. Although the dot is slightly misplaced at the origin, the coordinate (1;0) is clearly written, which satisfies the memorandum.
*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. The graph approaches the y-axis without crossing.

**S13: 0/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph is a straight line segment.

**S14: 3/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (1/1):** Correctly labeled at (1;0).
*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. The graph approaches the y-axis without crossing.

**S15: 0/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. This is the shape of an exponential graph (concave up).
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph passes through the origin, not (1;0).

**S16: 3/3**

*   **Asymptote (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph clearly crosses the y-axis.

**S18: 2/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph does not pass through (1;0). It appears to pass through the origin.
*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. Applying the leniency rule, the graph does not intentionally cross the y-axis.

**S19: 2/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct. The graph labeled h⁻¹ has a logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph does not pass through (1;0).
*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. The graph approaches the y-axis without crossing.

**S20: 2/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. A dot is placed at (1;0), but it is not labeled with coordinates or a "1" as required.

**S21: 3/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct logarithmic shape.
*   **X-intercept (1/1):** Correctly labeled at (1;0).
*   **Asymptote (1/1):** Correct. Applying the leniency rule, the graph comes very close but does not clearly cross the y-axis.

**S22: 0/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. This is a sine-like wave, not a logarithmic graph.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect.
*   **Asymptote (0/1):** Incorrect.

**S23: 0/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. This is just a curve with no axes for context. It does not show the characteristic shape of a logarithmic function.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** No axes provided.
*   **Asymptote (0/1):** No axes provided.

**S24: 1/3**
*   **Shape (1/1):** Correct. The general logarithmic shape is present.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** No axes provided, so the intercept cannot be marked.
*   **Asymptote (0/1):** No axes provided, so the asymptote cannot be assessed.

**S25: 0/3**
*   **Comment:** The student has written text instead of drawing a graph. The grading must be based on the provided memorandum, which requires a graph. Since no graph is present, no marks can be awarded.
*   **Shape (0/1):** No graph.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** No graph.
*   **Asymptote (0/1):** No graph.

**S26: 0/3**
*   **Comment:** The page is blank. No attempt was made.
*   **Shape (0/1):** No graph.
*   **X-intercept (0/1):** No graph.
*   **Asymptote (0/1):** No graph.
