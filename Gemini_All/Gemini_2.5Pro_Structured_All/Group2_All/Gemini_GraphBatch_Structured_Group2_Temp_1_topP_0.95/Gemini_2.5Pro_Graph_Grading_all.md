Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here are the grades for each of the 26 student graphs:

| Student | Shape Mark (1) | X-intercept Mark (1) | Asymptote Mark (1) | Total Mark (X/3) | Reasoning |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **S1** | 0 | 1 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape is incorrect as it is drawn with straight line segments. The x-intercept at (1,0) is correct, and the graph correctly respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S2** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S3** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S4** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S5** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape and correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0). The graph is given the benefit of the doubt for the asymptote mark. |
| **S6** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The student drew an incorrect type of graph. The shape is wrong, the x-intercept is not at (1,0), and the graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S7** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has a correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S8** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The student drew an exponential graph, not a logarithmic one. The shape, x-intercept, and asymptote are all incorrect for a log graph. |
| **S9** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S10** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S11** | 0 | 1 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape is incorrect as it is too linear and lacks the distinct curve of a log graph. The x-intercept and asymptote are correct. |
| **S12** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S13** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The student drew a straight line segment that does not show the correct shape, intercept, or asymptotic behavior. |
| **S14** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S15** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The student drew an exponential graph. The shape, x-intercept, and asymptote are all incorrect for a log graph. |
| **S16** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S17** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The student drew a straight line. The shape is incorrect, the x-intercept is not at (1,0), and the graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S18** | 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape is correct and the asymptote is respected. However, the x-intercept is not marked at (1,0). |
| **S19** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The shape is incorrect (concave up), the x-intercept is not at (1,0), and the graph crosses the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S20** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | The graph has the correct logarithmic shape, correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1,0), and respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S21** | 0 | 1 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape is incorrect as it appears to change concavity. The x-intercept and asymptote are correct. |
| **S22** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The drawing is not a logarithmic graph. All criteria are incorrect. |
| **S23** | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1/3** | No axes are drawn, so the intercept and asymptote cannot be assessed. The curve itself has the correct general shape. |
| **S24** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | No axes are drawn. The shape is incorrect as the graph flattens to horizontal, which is not characteristic of a log graph. |
| **S25** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | No graph is drawn. A written request for full marks does not meet the criteria. |
| **S26** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The page is blank; no graph is drawn. |
