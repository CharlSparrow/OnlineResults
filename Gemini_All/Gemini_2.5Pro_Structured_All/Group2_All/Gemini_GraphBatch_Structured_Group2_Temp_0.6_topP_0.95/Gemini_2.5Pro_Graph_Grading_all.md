Of course. Here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum and exemplars.

**Memorandum Recap:**
A student receives one mark for each of the following criteria, for a maximum of 3 marks:
1.  **Shape:** The graph has the general shape of an increasing logarithmic function (concave down).
2.  **X-intercept:** The graph correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1;0), either with coordinates or a dot and a "1".
3.  **Asymptote:** The graph approaches but does not cross the y-axis.

### **Grading of Student Graphs**

**Student 1 (S1): 2/3**
