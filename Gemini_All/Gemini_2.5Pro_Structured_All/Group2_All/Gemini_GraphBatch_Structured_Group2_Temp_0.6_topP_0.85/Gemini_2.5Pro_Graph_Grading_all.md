Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs.

**Grading Criteria:**
1.  **Shape (1 mark):** Correct logarithmic curve shape (increasing, concave down).
2.  **X-intercept (1 mark):** Correctly marked at (1;0) or with a '1' on the x-axis at the intersection.
3.  **Asymptote (1 mark):** Graph does not cross the y-axis.

**S23: 1/3**
- **Shape (1/1):** Correct. The curve itself has the correct logarithmic shape.
- **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. No axes are drawn, so the intercept cannot be shown.
- **Asymptote (0/1):** Incorrect. No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.

**S24: 0/3**
- **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. The graph flattens out to become horizontal, which is not a characteristic of a logarithmic graph.

**S25: 0/3**
- **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. No graph was drawn.
- **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. No graph was drawn.
- **Asymptote (0/1):** Incorrect. No graph was drawn.
- **Reasoning:** The student wrote a message instead of attempting the question. The memorandum's grading criteria must be applied, resulting in zero marks.

**S26: 0/3**
- **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. The page is blank.
- **X-intercept (0/1):** Incorrect. The page is blank.
- **Asymptote (0/1):** Incorrect. The page is blank.
- **Reasoning:** No attempt was made.
