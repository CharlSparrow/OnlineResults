Of course. Here is a grading of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum and exemplars.

### Grading Memorandum Criteria:

1.  **Shape (Vorm):** 1 mark for a shape similar to a logarithmic graph (increasing and concave down).
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** 1 mark for correctly indicating the intercept at (1;0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** 1 mark for the graph not crossing the y-axis.
