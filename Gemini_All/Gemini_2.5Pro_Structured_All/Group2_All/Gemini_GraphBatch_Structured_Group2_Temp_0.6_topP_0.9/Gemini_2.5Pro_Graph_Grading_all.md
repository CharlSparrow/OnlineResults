Of course. Here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs based on the provided memorandum and exemplars.

### Grading Summary

| Student | Shape (1) | X-Intercept (1) | Asymptote (1) | Total | Reasoning |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **S1** | 0 | 1 | 1 | **2/3** | Incorrect shape (straight line), but the x-intercept is correct and the asymptote is respected. (Matches exemplar) |
| **S2** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0) is clearly marked, and the graph respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S3** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0) is clearly marked, and the graph respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S4** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0) is clearly marked, and the graph respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S5** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0) is clearly marked, and the graph respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S6** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (not a log graph), no x-intercept at (1;0), and the graph crosses the y-axis. (Matches exemplar) |
| **S7** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0) is clearly marked, and the graph respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S8** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (exponential graph), no x-intercept at (1;0), and the graph crosses the y-axis. |
| **S9** | 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0) is clearly marked, and the graph respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S10**| 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0) is clearly marked, and the graph respects the y-axis asymptote. |
| **S11**| 0 | 1 | 1 | **2/3** | Incorrect shape (straight line), but the x-intercept at (1;0) is correct and the asymptote is respected. |
| **S12**| 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape is correct and the asymptote is respected, but the x-intercept is incorrectly marked at the origin (0;0) instead of (1;0). |
| **S13**| 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The graph is a straight line segment starting on the y-axis. The shape is incorrect, there is no intercept at (1;0), and it violates the asymptote. |
| **S14**| 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | A perfect example. Correct logarithmic shape, all key points including the x-intercept are marked, and the asymptote is respected. |
| **S15**| 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | Incorrect shape (exponential graph), no x-intercept at (1;0), and the graph starts at the origin, violating the asymptote. |
| **S16**| 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, the x-intercept is correctly indicated with a dot and a "1", and the asymptote is respected. |
| **S17**| 0 | 1 | 1 | **2/3** | Incorrect shape (straight line), but the x-intercept is correct and the asymptote is respected. |
| **S18**| 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | The shape is acceptable, and the asymptote is respected. However, the graph does not pass through the x-intercept at (1;0). |
| **S19**| 1 | 0 | 1 | **2/3** | The graph for h⁻¹ has the correct shape and respects the asymptote, but it does not pass through the correct x-intercept at (1;0). |
| **S20**| 1 | 1 | 1 | **3/3** | Correct logarithmic shape, the x-intercept at (1;0) is marked, and the student correctly identifies the y-axis as the asymptote. |
| **S21**| 1 | 1 | 0 | **2/3** | The shape and x-intercept are correct. However, the graph clearly and intentionally crosses the y-axis, violating the asymptote. |
| **S22**| 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The drawing does not resemble a logarithmic graph and lacks axes, an intercept, and an asymptote. |
| **S23**| 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | No axes are drawn, making it impossible to assess the intercept or asymptote. The shape alone is insufficient for any marks. |
| **S24**| 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | No axes are drawn, making it impossible to assess the intercept or asymptote. The shape alone is insufficient for any marks. |
| **S25**| 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The student wrote a message instead of drawing a graph. None of the criteria have been met. |
| **S26**| 0 | 0 | 0 | **0/3** | The page is blank. No attempt was made. |
