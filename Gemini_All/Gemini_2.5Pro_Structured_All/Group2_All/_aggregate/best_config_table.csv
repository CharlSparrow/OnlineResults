The memorandum defines three marks that can be obtained, making the maximum mark three:
A mark for the shape (vorm) of the graph being similar to that of a logarithmic graph with base two. The shape of the logarithmic graph is generally considered correct should the part of the graph above the x-axis is roughly pointing to the right.
A mark for correctly writing out the co-ordinate of the intersection between the logarithmic graph and the x-axis (x-afsnit). The correct co-ordinate is (1;0), it is also correct if the student draws a dot where the logarithmic graph intersects the x-axis and then writes a ""1"" nearby.
A mark for the students graph correctly respecting the asymptote (assimptoot), thus meaning that the students graph does not cross y-axis. Should there be ambiguity the student should be awarded the mark, meaning if it comes very close but does not actually cross the y-axis they still get the mark, a mark here should only be deducted if it appears that the student truely intentionally crossed the y-axis since this is a graph drawn by hand pencil artifacts etc likely make it look more wrong than it is.

Below follow examplars of grades assigned to graphs and their reasoning:
The memorandum shows an example of a perfect 3/3 graph, the shape is perfect for a logarithmic graph, the expected x-axis intersection is clearly shown and the graph does not violate the y-axis asymptote, thus the memo is the perfect example of a graph that would receive 3/3.
Student 1 (S1) is an example of a 2/3 graph, the shape of this graph is considered incorrect thus one mark is deducted, it does, however, not violate the asymptote and corectly shows the intersection between the graph and the x-axis thus the student receives 2/3.
Student 6 (S6) is an example of a 0/3 graph, the student drew an exponential graph, which is not a log graph as required, thus receiving zero out of three since it does violate the y-axis asymptote of a logarithmic graph, does not indicate the expected x-axis intersection with the graph and the expected shape is that of the memorandum shown logarithmic graph so the students graphs' shape is considered incorrect, thus the student receives 0/3.
