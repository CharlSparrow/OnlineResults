Based on the memorandum provided, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs. Each student is graded out of 3, with one mark awarded for each of the following criteria: correct shape, correct x-intercept, and respecting the asymptote.

**Note on Exemplars:** The grading below adheres strictly to the three rules defined in the memorandum. The exemplar description for Student 1 (S1) in the prompt appears to be inconsistent with the S1 image provided and the grading rules (e.g., S1 drew an exponential graph, similar to S6 who received 0/3). Therefore, S1 has been graded according to a consistent application of the rules, resulting in a score of 0/3.

    *   The page is blank. No attempt was made.
