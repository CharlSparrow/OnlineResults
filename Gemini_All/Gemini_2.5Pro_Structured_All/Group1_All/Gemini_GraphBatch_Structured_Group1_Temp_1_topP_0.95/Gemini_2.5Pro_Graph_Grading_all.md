Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here are the grades for each of the 26 student graphs, marked out of 3.

The marking criteria are as follows:
*   **1 Mark for Shape (Vorm):** A rising curve that is concave down, resembling the logarithmic graph in the memorandum.
*   **1 Mark for X-intercept (x-afsnit):** The graph correctly indicates the x-intercept at (1;0), either by writing the coordinate or marking a dot at x=1 on the axis.
*   **1 Mark for Asymptote (Assimptoot):** The graph approaches but does not cross the y-axis.

### **Grading of Student Graphs**

*   **S1:** **2/3**
    *   **Shape (0/1):** The shape is incorrect; it is too curved, resembling a sideways parabola rather than a logarithmic curve.
    *   **X-intercept (1/1):** Although the x-intercept at (1,0) is not marked, the student has plotted other correct points on the graph, such as (2,1) and (1/2, -1). Following the lenient interpretation from the exemplar notes, this demonstrates sufficient understanding for the mark.
    *   **Asymptote (1/1):** The graph correctly respects the y-axis as an asymptote.

*   **S2:** **3/3**
    *   **Shape (1/1):** The shape of the graph is correct.
    *   **X-intercept (1/1):** The x-intercept is correctly marked at (1;0).
