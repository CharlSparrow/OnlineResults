Based on the memorandum and exemplars provided, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs.

The grading is based on three criteria, each worth one mark:
1.  **Shape:** The graph must have the characteristic shape of an increasing logarithmic function (concave down).
2.  **X-intercept:** The graph must correctly identify the x-intercept at (1;0).
3.  **Asymptote:** The graph must approach the y-axis as a vertical asymptote and not cross it.

*(Note: The provided reasoning for the S1 exemplar being 2/3 is inconsistent with its corresponding image and the grading criteria. The image for S1 violates all three criteria. Therefore, the grading below is based on a consistent application of the memorandum's rules and the S6 exemplar.)*
