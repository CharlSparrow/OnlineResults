Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs. Each graph is marked out of 3, with one mark awarded for each of the following criteria:
1.  **Shape (Vorm):** A correct concave-down, increasing logarithmic curve.
2.  **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** Correctly indicated at (1;0).
3.  **Asymptote (assimptoot):** The graph correctly approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
