Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs. Each graph is assessed on three criteria for a maximum of 3 marks:
1.  **Shape:** 1 mark for a correct logarithmic shape (increasing and concave down).
2.  **X-intercept:** 1 mark for correctly indicating the intercept at (1;0).
3.  **Asymptote:** 1 mark for respecting the y-axis as a vertical asymptote (not crossing it).

**Student 23 (S23): 0/3**
*   **Shape (0/1):** Incorrect. While the curve has a logarithmic shape, it is not drawn on a Cartesian plane, so its properties (intercept, asymptote) cannot be determined.
