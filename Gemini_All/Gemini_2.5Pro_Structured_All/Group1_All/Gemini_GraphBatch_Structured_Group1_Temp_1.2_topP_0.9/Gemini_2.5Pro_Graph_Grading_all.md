Based on the memorandum and exemplars provided, here are the grades for each of the 26 student graphs.

The grading is based on three criteria, each worth one mark:
1.  **Shape:** The graph must have a logarithmic shape (increasing and concave down).
2.  **X-intercept/Points:** The graph must correctly indicate the x-intercept at (1;0) OR have at least two other correct points for y=log₂(x) plotted and labelled.
3.  **Asymptote:** The graph must not cross the y-axis.
