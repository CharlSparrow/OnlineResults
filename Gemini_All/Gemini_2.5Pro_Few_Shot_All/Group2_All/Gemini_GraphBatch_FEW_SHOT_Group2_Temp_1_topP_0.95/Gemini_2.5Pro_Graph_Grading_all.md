Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs.

The grading criteria are as follows, for a total of 3 marks:
*   **1 Mark: Correct Shape** (Increasing logarithmic curve)
*   **1 Mark: Correct X-intercept** (Passes through the point (1, 0))
*   **1 Mark: Correct Asymptote** (Approaches the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical asymptote)

---
### **Student Grades**

**Student 1: 2/3**
*   **Reason:** Correct x-intercept and asymptote, but the shape is incorrect (drawn with straight lines).

**Student 2: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 3: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 4: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 5: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 6: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** The graph drawn is not a logarithmic function.

**Student 7: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 8: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** An exponential graph was drawn, not a logarithmic graph.

**Student 9: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 10: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 11: 2/3**
*   **Reason:** Correct x-intercept and asymptote, but the shape is partially a straight line, which is incorrect.

**Student 12: 1/3**
*   **Reason:** The general shape is correct, but the x-intercept is wrong (passes through (0,0)), and the asymptote is not correctly shown.

**Student 13: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** The graph is a straight line and does not have the correct features.

**Student 14: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 15: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** An exponential graph was drawn, not a logarithmic graph.

**Student 16: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 17: 2/3**
*   **Reason:** Correct x-intercept and asymptote, but the shape is incorrect (drawn as a straight line).

**Student 18: 2/3**
*   **Reason:** The shape and asymptote are correct, but the x-intercept is incorrect.

**Student 19: 2/3**
*   **Reason:** The shape and asymptote are correct, but the x-intercept appears to be incorrect (not clearly through (1,0)).

**Student 20: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 21: 3/3**
*   **Reason:** Perfect. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

**Student 22: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** The graph drawn is not a logarithmic function.

**Student 23: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** Incomplete answer. A curve is drawn without axes, so no features can be graded.

**Student 24: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** Incomplete answer and incorrect shape. No axes are provided.

**Student 25: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** No graph was drawn.

**Student 26: 0/3**
*   **Reason:** No attempt was made.
