Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs.

The marking criteria derived from the memo are as follows (3 marks total):
*   **1 Mark:** Correct shape (an increasing, concave down logarithmic curve).
*   **1 Mark:** Correct x-intercept at (1, 0).
*   **1 Mark:** Correct vertical asymptote (the y-axis) and/or at least one other correctly plotted point (e.g., (1/2, -1), (2, 1), (4, 2)).

**Student Grades:**

*   **Student 1: 2/3** (As per the exemplar. The shape is incorrect (straight line), but the x-intercept and another point are correct.)
*   **Student 2: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct point at (2,1).)
*   **Student 3: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct point at (1/2, -1).)
*   **Student 4: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct point at (2,1).)
*   **Student 5: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct point at (1/2, -1).)
*   **Student 6: 0/3** (As per the exemplar. The student drew a hyperbola, not a log graph.)
*   **Student 7: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct points at (2,1) and (4,2).)
*   **Student 8: 0/3** (Incorrect graph type. This is an exponential graph, not a logarithmic graph.)
*   **Student 9: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct point at (1/2, -1).)
*   **Student 10: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct point at (1/2, -1).)
*   **Student 11: 2/3** (Incorrect shape (straight line), but correct x-intercept and point at (1/2, -1).)
*   **Student 12: 2/3** (Correct shape and correct points at (2,1) and (4,2), but the x-intercept is incorrectly drawn.)
*   **Student 13: 1/3** (Incorrect shape (straight line) and no clear x-intercept at (1,0), but has correct points plotted at (2,1) and (4,2).)
*   **Student 14: 3/3** (Excellent graph. Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and multiple correct points.)
*   **Student 15: 0/3** (Incorrect graph type. This is an exponential graph.)
*   **Student 16: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct point at (2,1).)
*   **Student 17: 2/3** (Incorrect shape (straight line), but correct x-intercept and implies other correct points.)
*   **Student 18: 2/3** (Correct shape and multiple correct points, but the curve misses the required x-intercept at (1,0).)
*   **Student 19: 2/3** (Correct shape and correct point at (1/2, -1), but the x-intercept is incorrect.)
*   **Student 20: 3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and correct point at (1/2, -1).)
*   **Student 21: 2/3** (Correct shape and x-intercept, but the second point is incorrectly labeled as (1/2, 1) instead of (1/2, -1).)
*   **Student 22: 0/3** (Incorrect shape. The drawing is a wavy line.)
*   **Student 23: 0/3** (No axes are drawn, making the graph impossible to assess.)
*   **Student 24: 0/3** (The shape and orientation are incorrect. The graph has a horizontal asymptote, not a vertical one.)
*   **Student 25: 0/3** (This is not a graph but a written instruction. No attempt at the question.)
*   **Student 26: 0/3** (Blank page. No attempt.)
