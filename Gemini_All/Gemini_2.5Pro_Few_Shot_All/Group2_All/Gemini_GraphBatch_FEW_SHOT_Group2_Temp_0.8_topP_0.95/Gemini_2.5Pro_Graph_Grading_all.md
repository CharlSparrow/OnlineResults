Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs.

The grading criteria are as follows, with one mark awarded for each point:
1.  **Correct Shape:** The graph must be an increasing, concave-down logarithmic curve.
2.  **Correct X-intercept:** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Correct Asymptote:** The graph must approach the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical asymptote.

### **Grading Results**

*   **Student 1:** **2/3** (Correct x-intercept and asymptote, but incorrect shape - piecewise linear).
*   **Student 2:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 3:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 4:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 5:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 6:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph type - not a log graph).
*   **Student 7:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 8:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph type - exponential graph).
*   **Student 9:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 10:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 11:** **2/3** (Correct x-intercept and asymptote, but incorrect shape - concave up).
*   **Student 12:** **1/3** (Correct general shape, but incorrect x-intercept at (0,0) and therefore no vertical asymptote at x=0).
*   **Student 13:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - linear, incorrect x-intercept, and no clear asymptote).
*   **Student 14:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 15:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph type - exponential graph).
*   **Student 16:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 17:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - straight line, and incorrect x-intercept).
*   **Student 18:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 19:** **2/3** (Correct shape and asymptote, but incorrect x-intercept).
*   **Student 20:** **2/3** (Correct shape and asymptote, but incorrect x-intercept - not at x=1).
*   **Student 21:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
*   **Student 22:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - not a log graph).
*   **Student 23:** **0/3** (Incomplete - no axes provided).
*   **Student 24:** **1/3** (Correct shape, but no axes to judge intercept or asymptote).
*   **Student 25:** **0/3** (No graph drawn).
*   **Student 26:** **0/3** (No graph drawn).
