Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each student's graph out of 3.

The marking criteria are:
1.  **Correct Shape (1 mark):** The graph must be a smooth, increasing, concave-down curve, representing a logarithmic function.
2.  **Correct X-intercept (1 mark):** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Correct Asymptote (1 mark):** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0), meaning it approaches the y-axis from the right but never touches or crosses it.

**Grading:**

*   **Student 1:** **2/3**. (Exemplar) Incorrect shape (piecewise linear), but correct x-intercept and asymptote.
*   **Student 2:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 3:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 4:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 5:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 6:** **0/3**. (Exemplar) Incorrect type of graph.
*   **Student 7:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 8:** **0/3**. Incorrect graph type (exponential, concave up).
*   **Student 9:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 10:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 11:** **2/3**. Incorrect shape (too linear), but correct x-intercept and asymptote.
*   **Student 12:** **1/3**. Incorrectly starts at the origin, so no asymptote. X-intercept is correct. The overall shape is flawed.
*   **Student 13:** **0/3**. Incorrect shape (piecewise linear) and incorrect x-intercept.
*   **Student 14:** **3/3**. Excellent graph. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 15:** **0/3**. Incorrect graph type (exponential).
*   **Student 16:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 17:** **1/3**. Incorrect shape (linear) and no vertical asymptote, but the x-intercept is correct.
*   **Student 18:** **2/3**. Correct shape and asymptote, but the x-intercept is incorrect.
*   **Student 19:** **1/3**. Incorrect shape (concave up) and incorrect x-intercept, but the asymptote is correct.
*   **Student 20:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.
*   **Student 21:** **3/3**. Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote. The incorrectly labeled second point does not affect the score based on the memo.
*   **Student 22:** **0/3**. Incorrect graph (wavy line).
*   **Student 23:** **0/3**. Incomplete sketch with no axes.
*   **Student 24:** **1/3**. Correct shape, but no axes are drawn, so the x-intercept and asymptote cannot be verified.
*   **Student 25:** **0/3**. No graph drawn.
*   **Student 26:** **0/3**. Blank page, no attempt.
