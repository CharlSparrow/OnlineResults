Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, the grading for each student's graph is as follows.

The marking criteria out of 3 are:
1.  **Correct Shape:** 1 mark for a correctly drawn increasing, concave-down logarithmic curve.
2.  **Correct X-intercept:** 1 mark for the graph passing through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Correct Asymptote/Second Point:** 1 mark for showing the correct vertical asymptote (the y-axis) OR plotting at least one other correct point (e.g., (1/2, -1), (2, 1)).

Here is the breakdown for each student:

*   **Student 1:** **2/3** (Exemplar: Incorrect shape (straight line segments), but correct x-intercept and another point).
*   **Student 2:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second point (2,1)).
*   **Student 3:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second point (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 4:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second point (2,1)).
*   **Student 5:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second point (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 6:** **0/3** (Exemplar: Completely incorrect graph type).
*   **Student 7:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second points (2,1) and (4,2)).
*   **Student 8:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph type; an exponential function was drawn, not a logarithmic one).
*   **Student 9:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second point (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 10:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second point (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 11:** **2/3** (Incorrect shape, resembles a straight line, but has the correct x-intercept (1,0) and second point (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 12:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second points (2,1) and (4,2)).
*   **Student 13:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape (straight line) and incorrect x-intercept, but two correct points (2,1) and (4,2) are plotted).
*   **Student 14:** **3/3** (Excellent graph with correct shape, x-intercept, and multiple correct points plotted).
*   **Student 15:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph type; an exponential function was drawn, not a logarithmic one).
*   **Student 16:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), correct second point (2,1)).
*   **Student 17:** **2/3** (Incorrect shape (straight line), but correct x-intercept and other points).
*   **Student 18:** **2/3** (Correct shape and correct points plotted, but the x-intercept is incorrect).
*   **Student 19:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape (concave up) and incorrect x-intercept, but one correct point (1/2, -1) is plotted).
*   **Student 20:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept (passes through 1,0), correct second point (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 21:** **2/3** (Correct shape and correct x-intercept (1,0), but the second point (1/2, 1) is incorrect).
*   **Student 22:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape, no discernible features of a log graph).
*   **Student 23:** **0/3** (An unconnected curve with no axes; cannot be graded).
*   **Student 24:** **1/3** (Correct logarithmic shape, but no axes or points are shown, so only the mark for shape can be awarded).
*   **Student 25:** **0/3** (No graph drawn; text request for marks is not a valid answer).
*   **Student 26:** **0/3** (Blank; no attempt).
