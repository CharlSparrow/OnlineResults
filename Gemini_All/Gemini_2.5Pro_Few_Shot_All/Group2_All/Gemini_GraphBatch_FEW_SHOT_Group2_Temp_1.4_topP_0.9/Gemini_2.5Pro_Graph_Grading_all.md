Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, here is the grading for each of the 26 student graphs:

**Marking Criteria (out of 3):**
*   **1 Mark:** Correct shape (increasing, concave-down logarithmic curve).
*   **1 Mark:** Correct x-intercept at the point (1, 0).
*   **1 Mark:** Correct vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0) and correct position in quadrants I and IV.

---

**Student 1:** **2/3** (As per exemplar: Shape is incorrect as it's made of straight lines, but intercepts and points are correct).
**Student 2:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 3:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 4:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 5:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 6:** **0/3** (As per exemplar: Incorrect graph type - hyperbola, not a log graph).
**Student 7:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 8:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph type: exponential, not logarithmic. Shape is concave up and there is no vertical asymptote).
**Student 9:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 10:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 11:** **2/3** (Incorrect shape - the graph is almost a straight line, not a distinct curve. X-intercept and position are correct).
**Student 12:** **2/3** (Shape and asymptote are correct, but the x-intercept is incorrectly plotted at the origin (0,0) instead of (1,0)).
**Student 13:** **0/3** (Incorrect shape - straight line. Incorrect intercept and no clear asymptote).
**Student 14:** **3/3** (Excellent graph. Correct shape, x-intercept, asymptote, and multiple points plotted correctly).
**Student 15:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph type: exponential, not logarithmic).
**Student 16:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 17:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape - straight line. Does not have an asymptote at the y-axis as the line continues into quadrant II. Only the x-intercept at (1,0) is correct).
**Student 18:** **2/3** (Correct shape and asymptote, but the x-intercept at (1,0) is missing).
**Student 19:** **2/3** (The graph for h⁻¹ has the correct shape and asymptote, but the x-intercept is clearly not at (1,0)).
**Student 20:** **3/3** (Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote).
**Student 21:** **3/3** (The graph is drawn correctly with the right shape, intercept and asymptote. The mislabeling of point (1/2, -1) as (1/2, 1) is a minor error that doesn't affect the graphical marks).
**Student 22:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph).
**Student 23:** **0/3** (Incomplete - no axes provided to assess intercept or asymptote).
**Student 24:** **0/3** (Incomplete - no axes provided to assess intercept or asymptote).
**Student 25:** **0/3** (This is not a graph).
**Student 26:** **0/3** (Blank - no attempt).
