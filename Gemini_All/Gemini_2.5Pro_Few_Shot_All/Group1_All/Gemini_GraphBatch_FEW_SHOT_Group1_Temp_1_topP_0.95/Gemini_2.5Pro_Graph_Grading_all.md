Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, the grading rubric for the logarithmic graph is as follows, out of a total of 3 marks:

*   **1 Mark for Shape:** The graph must be an increasing, concave-down curve, typical of a standard log function.
*   **1 Mark for Points/Intercept:** The graph must pass through the correct x-intercept at (1, 0) and/or other correctly plotted points (e.g., (1/2, -1), (2, 1)).
*   **1 Mark for Asymptote:** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0).

Here is the grading for each student from 1 to 26:

**Student 9: 3/3**
- Shape: Correct.
- Points: Correct (includes (1, 0) and (1/2, -1)).
- Asymptote: Correct.

**Student 10: 3/3**
- Shape: Correct.

- Asymptote: Correct.

**Student 11: 3/3**
- Shape: Correct.
- Points: Correct (includes (1, 0) and (1/2, -1)).
- Asymptote: Correct.

**Student 12: 3/3**
- Shape: Correct.
- Points: Correct (includes (1, 0), (2, 1), (4, 2)).
- Asymptote: Correct.

**Student 13: 1/3**
- Shape: Incorrect (concave up).
- Points: Correct (shows points (2, 1) and (4, 2)).
- Asymptote: Incorrect (graph starts at x=1, not showing asymptote at x=0).

**Student 14: 3/3**
- Shape: Correct.
- Points: Correct (multiple points correctly plotted, including x-intercept).
- Asymptote: Correct.

**Student 15: 0/3**
- Shape: Incorrect (concave up).
- Points: Incorrect (passes through origin (0,0), not (1,0)).
- Asymptote: Incorrect (touches the y-axis).

**Student 16: 3/3**
- Shape: Correct.
- Points: Correct (includes (1, 0) and (2, 1)).
- Asymptote: Correct.

**Student 17: 1/3**
- Shape: Incorrect (drawn as a straight line).
- Points: Correct (passes through correct points like (1, 0) and (2,1)).
- Asymptote: Incorrect (a straight line cannot have an asymptote; it crosses the y-axis).

**Student 18: 2/3**
- Shape: Incorrect (not a smooth curve, concavity is ambiguous).
- Points: Correct (includes (1,0), (2,1), and (1/2, -1)).
- Asymptote: Correct.
