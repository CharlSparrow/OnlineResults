Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, the grading rubric for the log graph is as follows:

*   **1 Mark for Shape:** The graph must have the correct increasing, concave-down shape of a logarithmic function.
*   **1 Mark for Asymptote:** The graph must correctly show the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical asymptote and not cross into the negative x-axis.
*   **1 Mark for Points:** The graph must pass through at least one correct point. Key points for this function (likely y=log₂(x)) are (1, 0), (1/2, -1), (2, 1), and (4, 2).

Here are the grades for each student from 1 to 26:

**Student 1:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape (concave up), but correct asymptote and points)
**Student 2:** 3/3 (Correct shape, asymptote, and points)
**Student 3:** 3/3 (Correct shape, asymptote, and points)
**Student 4:** 3/3 (Correct shape, asymptote, and points)
**Student 5:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape (too linear), but correct asymptote and points)
**Student 6:** 0/3 (Incorrect graph type - exponential)
**Student 7:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape (concave up), but correct asymptote and points)
**Student 8:** 1/3 (Incorrect shape (segmented line) and no clear asymptote, but correct points plotted)
**Student 9:** 3/3 (Correct shape, asymptote, and points)
**Student 10:** 3/3 (Correct shape, asymptote, and points)

**Student 22:** 0/3 (Incorrect shape, no asymptote, no points)
**Student 23:** 0/3 (No axes or points, incorrect shape)
**Student 24:** 0/3 (No axes or points, incorrect shape that flattens out)
**Student 25:** 0/3 (No graph drawn)
**Student 26:** 0/3 (No graph drawn)
