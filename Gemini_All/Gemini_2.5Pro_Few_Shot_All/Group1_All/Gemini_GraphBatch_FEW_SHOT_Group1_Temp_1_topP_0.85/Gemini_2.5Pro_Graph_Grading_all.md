Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, the grading criteria for the logarithmic graph are as follows, out of a total of 3 marks:

1.  **Correct Shape (1 mark):** The graph must be an increasing, concave-down logarithmic curve with a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0).
2.  **Correct X-intercept (1 mark):** The graph must pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Correct Point(s) / Asymptote (1 mark):** The graph must clearly show the vertical asymptote at x=0 and/or include at least one other correctly plotted point, such as (1/2, -1), (2, 1), or (4, 2).

*   A **perfect graph (3/3)**, like the memo, meets all three criteria.
*   The exemplar for **Student 1 (2/3)** indicates that if the shape and intercept are incorrect, a student can still receive marks for plotting correct points. In this case, Student 1 plotted two correct points, (2, 1) and (1/2, -1), earning them 2 marks.
*   The exemplar for **Student 6 (0/3)** shows that drawing a completely incorrect type of function (e.g., exponential) receives no marks.

Here are the grades for each student from 1 to 26:

*   **Student 1:** **2/3** (Given exemplar. Incorrect shape and intercept, but two correct points are plotted).
*   **Student 2:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (2,1)).
*   **Student 3:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 4:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (2,1)).
*   **Student 5:** **2/3** (The shape is too linear, not concave down. However, the x-intercept at (1,0) is correct, and the point (1/2, -1) is correct).
*   **Student 6:** **0/3** (Given exemplar. Incorrect function type).
*   **Student 7:** **2/3** (The shape is incorrect (piecewise linear). The x-intercept at (1,0) is correct, and the point (2,1) is correct).
*   **Student 8:** **2/3** (Incorrect shape (piecewise linear) and no clear x-intercept at (1,0). However, two correct points, (2,1) and (4,2), are plotted).
*   **Student 9:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 10:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 11:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 12:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and other correct points at (2,1) and (4,2)).
*   **Student 13:** **2/3** (The graph is incomplete (no intercept or asymptote shown), so the shape is incorrect. However, two correct points, (2,1) and (4,2), are plotted).
*   **Student 14:** **3/3** (Excellent graph. Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and multiple other correct points plotted).
*   **Student 15:** **2/3** (Incorrect shape, as it starts from the origin and has no vertical asymptote. The x-intercept is also incorrect. However, two correct points, (2,1) and (4,2), are plotted).
*   **Student 16:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (2,1)).
*   **Student 17:** **2/3** (Incorrect shape (a straight line). However, the x-intercept at (1,0) is correct, and the point (1/2, -1) is also correct).
*   **Student 18:** **2/3** (The shape is not a smooth curve and the x-intercept is not at (1,0). However, two correct points, (1/2, -1) and (2,1), are plotted).
*   **Student 19:** **2/3** (The shape is correct and the point (1/2, -1) is correct. However, the x-intercept is not at (1,0)).
*   **Student 20:** **2/3** (Incorrect shape (a straight line). However, the x-intercept at (1,0) is correct, and the point (1/2, -1) is also correct).
*   **Student 21:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and another correct point at (1/2, -1)).
*   **Student 22:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph).
*   **Student 23:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph, no axes).
*   **Student 24:** **0/3** (Incorrect graph, no axes).
*   **Student 25:** **0/3** (No graph is drawn. Instructions to the grader are ignored).
*   **Student 26:** **0/3** (Blank page, no graph drawn).
