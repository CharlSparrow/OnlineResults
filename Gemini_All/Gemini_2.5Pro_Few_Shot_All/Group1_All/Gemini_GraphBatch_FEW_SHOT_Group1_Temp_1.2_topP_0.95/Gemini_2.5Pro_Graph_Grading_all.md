Based on the memorandum and the provided exemplars, I have established the following 3-point marking criteria for the logarithmic graph:

1.  **Correct Shape (1 mark):** The graph must have the correct increasing, concave-down shape of a logarithmic function.
2.  **Correct X-intercept (1 mark):** The graph must clearly pass through the point (1, 0).
3.  **Correct Asymptote / Additional Point (1 mark):** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0) and/or include at least one other correctly plotted and labeled point (e.g., (1/2, -1), (2, 1), (4, 2)).

Here is the grading for each student from 1 to 26:

**Student 1:** **2/3** (Following the prompt's instruction that this is a 2/3 example where the shape is incorrect. Marks are awarded for the asymptote and correctly plotted points, but not the shape.)
**Student 2:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 3:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 4:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 5:** **2/3** (The shape is more of a straight line, losing 1 mark. The x-intercept and another point are correct.)
**Student 6:** **0/3** (As per the exemplar, the graph is exponential, not logarithmic. Incorrect shape, intercept, and asymptote.)
**Student 7:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional points.)
**Student 8:** **1/3** (The "shape" consists of straight line segments, which is incorrect. The graph does not pass through the x-intercept (1,0). One mark is awarded for plotting other points correctly.)
**Student 9:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 10:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 11:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 12:** **3/3** (Excellent graph. Correct shape, correct x-intercept, and multiple correct points shown.)
**Student 13:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape, resembling a square root function with no asymptote. No x-intercept at (1,0). One mark for correctly plotted points.)
**Student 14:** **3/3** (Excellent graph. Correct shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote, and multiple correctly plotted points.)
**Student 15:** **1/3** (Incorrect shape, starts at the origin. Incorrect intercept. One mark is awarded for plotting other points correctly.)
**Student 16:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 17:** **2/3** (The shape is a straight line, which is incorrect. However, it passes through the correct x-intercept (1,0) and another correct point.)
**Student 18:** **2/3** (The shape and asymptote are correct. However, the x-intercept is incorrectly placed before x=1.)
**Student 19:** **0/3** (Two incorrect graphs are drawn. The intended log graph does not have the correct x-intercept.)
**Student 20:** **2/3** (The shape is a straight line, which is incorrect. However, it passes through the correct x-intercept (1,0) and another correct point.)
**Student 21:** **3/3** (Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), and correct asymptote/additional point.)
**Student 22:** **0/3** (The graph is an incorrect wavy line with no features of a log graph.)
**Student 23:** **0/3** (The shape is incorrect, possibly a parabola, with no correct features.)
**Student 24:** **1/3** (The shape is recognizably a log curve, but there are no axes, intercepts, or points indicated.)
**Student 25:** **0/3** (There is no graph drawn. Instructions written by the student are ignored.)
**Student 26:** **0/3** (Blank paper. No graph drawn.)
