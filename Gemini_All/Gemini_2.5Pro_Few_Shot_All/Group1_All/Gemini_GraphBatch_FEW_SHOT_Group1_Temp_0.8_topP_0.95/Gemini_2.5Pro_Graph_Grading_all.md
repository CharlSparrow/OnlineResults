Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, the following grading rubric has been established:

*   **1 Mark for Correct Shape:** The graph must be an increasing logarithmic function, showing a smooth curve that is concave down.
*   **1 Mark for Correct Asymptote:** The graph must show a vertical asymptote at x=0 (the y-axis) and not cross it.
*   **1 Mark for Correct Points:** At least two key points must be correctly plotted. These include the x-intercept (1,0) and other points like (1/2, -1), (2,1), or (4,2).

Here are the grades for each student:
