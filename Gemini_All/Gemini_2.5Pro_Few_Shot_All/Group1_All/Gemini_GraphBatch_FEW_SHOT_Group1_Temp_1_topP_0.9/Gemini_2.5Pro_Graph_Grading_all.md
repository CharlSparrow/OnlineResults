Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, the grading rubric for the log graph is as follows:

*   **Total Marks:** 3
*   **Fundamental Requirement:** The graph must be a logarithmic function. If a different type of function is drawn (e.g., exponential, linear, parabola), 0 marks are awarded. (Based on Student 6 exemplar).
*   **Mark 1: Correct Shape:** The graph must be an increasing logarithmic curve (concave down, showing it rises but flattens out) with a vertical asymptote at the y-axis. An incorrect shape (e.g., concave up, piecewise linear) does not get this mark. (Based on Student 1 exemplar).
*   **Mark 2: Correct Point 1:** The graph must pass through at least one correct, identifiable point. Common points are the x-intercept (1, 0) or (1/2, -1).
*   **Mark 3: Correct Point 2:** The graph must pass through a second correct, identifiable point. Common points include (1, 0), (1/2, -1), (2, 1), or (4, 2).

Here is the grading for each student from 1 to 26:

**Student 1:** 2/3 (Given exemplar: Shape is incorrect (concave up), but two points (1/2, -1) and (2,1) are correct).
**Student 2:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (2,1)).
**Student 3:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (1/2, -1)).
**Student 4:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (2,1)).
**Student 5:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (1/2, -1)).
**Student 6:** 0/3 (Given exemplar: Incorrect function type drawn - exponential/hyperbolic, not logarithmic).
**Student 7:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (2,1)).
**Student 8:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape - drawn as connected line segments, not a smooth curve. However, it passes through correct points (2,1) and (4,2)).
**Student 9:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (1/2, -1)).
**Student 10:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (1/2, -1)).
**Student 11:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (1/2, -1)).
**Student 12:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0), (2,1), and (4,2)).
**Student 13:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape - does not show asymptotic behavior and starts from a fixed point. However, it passes through correct points (2,1) and (4,2)).
**Student 14:** 3/3 (Perfect graph: correct shape and multiple correct points plotted).
**Student 15:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape - concave up. However, it passes through correct points (2,1) and (4,2)).
**Student 16:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (2,1)).
**Student 17:** 0/3 (Incorrect function type - a straight line is drawn).
**Student 18:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape - drawn as connected line segments. However, it passes through correct points (1/2, -1) and (2,1)).
**Student 19:** 0/3 (Incorrect function type - two graphs are drawn, neither of which is the required log graph).
**Student 20:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape - drawn as connected line segments. However, it passes through correct points (1,0) and (1/2, -1)).
**Student 21:** 3/3 (Correct shape, passes through (1,0) and (1/2, -1)).
**Student 22:** 0/3 (Incorrect drawing - this is a wavy horizontal line, not a log graph).
**Student 23:** 0/3 (Incorrect drawing - this is a vertical curve, not a log graph).
**Student 24:** 0/3 (Incorrect shape - this is a sideways parabola/quarter circle, not a log graph).
**Student 25:** 0/3 (No graph drawn, text does not fulfill the requirements).
**Student 26:** 0/3 (Blank paper, no attempt).
