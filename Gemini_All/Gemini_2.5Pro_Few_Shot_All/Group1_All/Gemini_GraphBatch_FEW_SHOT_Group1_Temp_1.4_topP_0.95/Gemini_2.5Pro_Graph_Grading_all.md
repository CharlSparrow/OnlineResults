Based on the provided memorandum and exemplars, the following grading rubric has been established:

**Grading Rubric (Total 3 Marks)**

1.  **Mark 1: First Correct Point.** One mark is awarded for correctly plotting and/or labeling a valid point on the log graph (e.g., the x-intercept at (1,0), or another point like (2,1) or (1/2, -1)).
2.  **Mark 2: Second Correct Point.** A second mark is awarded for correctly plotting and/or labeling another valid point on the graph.
3.  **Mark 3: Shape and Asymptote.** One mark is awarded for drawing the correct increasing, concave-down shape of a logarithmic function with a vertical asymptote at the y-axis (x=0).

*   If the graph is of a completely incorrect type (e.g., exponential, linear), it receives **0/3**, as shown by the example for Student 6.

Here are the grades for each student from 1 to 26:

*   **Student 1:** **2/3**. (Exemplar) Has two correct points plotted ((2,1) and (1/2, -1)), but the shape and asymptote are incorrect.
*   **Student 2:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (2,1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 3:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (1/2, -1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 4:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (2,1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 5:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (1/2, -1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 6:** **0/3**. (Exemplar) The graph drawn is not a logarithmic function.
*   **Student 7:** **2/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (2,1)) are plotted, but the shape is incorrect (too linear).
*   **Student 8:** **2/3**. Two correct points ((2,1) and (4,2)) are plotted, but the graph is drawn as connected line segments, not a smooth curve (incorrect shape).
*   **Student 9:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (1/2, -1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 10:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (1/2, -1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 11:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (1/2, -1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 12:** **3/3**. Has at least two correct points ((1,0), (2,1), (4,2)) plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 13:** **2/3**. Two correct points ((2,1) and (4,2)) are plotted, but the shape is incorrect as it does not approach a vertical asymptote.
*   **Student 14:** **3/3**. Multiple correct points are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct. A perfect graph.
*   **Student 15:** **2/3**. Two correct points ((2,1) and (4,2)) are plotted, but the shape is incorrect as the graph starts from the origin.
*   **Student 16:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (2,1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 17:** **0/3**. The graph appears to be a straight line and the plotted points are incorrect.
*   **Student 18:** **2/3**. Has at least two correct points ((1/2, -1) and (2,1)), but the shape is not a smooth concave-down curve.
*   **Student 19:** **2/3**. The correct log graph (`h⁻¹`) has a correct shape/asymptote and one correctly labeled point (1/2, -1). The x-intercept is correctly placed but not labeled, so one mark for shape and one for the labeled point.
*   **Student 20:** **1/3**. One correct point (1/2, -1) is labeled, but the shape is incorrect (linear) and no second point is clearly indicated.
*   **Student 21:** **3/3**. Two correct points ((1,0) and (1/2, -1)) are plotted, and the shape and asymptote are correct.
*   **Student 22:** **0/3**. Not a graph of a logarithmic function.
*   **Student 23:** **0/3**. No axes or points are provided, making it impossible to grade.
*   **Student 24:** **0/3**. No axes or points are provided.
*   **Student 25:** **0/3**. This is not an attempt at the question.
*   **Student 26:** **0/3**. Blank paper.
