Student S-A1:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: Although the graph is somewhat straight, the plotted points imply a curve. Applying the "benefit of the doubt" principle, the shape is accepted as concave down.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not clearly pass through x=1. The dot for the intercept is placed visibly to the right of the tick mark for x=1.
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it, respecting the vertical asymptote.
