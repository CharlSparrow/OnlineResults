Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every single graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for leniency and correctness.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing (it goes up as it moves from left to right).
The graph displays clear concave down curvature (it bends downwards like an arch). A slight but noticeable curve is sufficient.
The graph becomes steeper as it approaches the y-axis from the right.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is perfectly linear (a straight line). Exception: If there is a slight, noticeable attempt at a curve, award the mark under the BoD principle.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape).
The graph resembles an exponential function (e.g., y=a^x) or any other incorrect function type.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value (e.g., 2, -1, or on the y-axis).
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
The graph line ends before reaching the y-axis.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The line clearly and deliberately extends into the second or third quadrants (where x < 0).
Leniency Rule: If the line gets very close to or appears to ""smudge"" onto the y-axis due to pencil artifacts or hand-drawn imprecision, award the mark. The deduction is reserved for clear conceptual errors.
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, you must follow this exact procedure and format.
Analyze the Shape: Compare the graph to the 'Shape' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the X-Intercept: Compare the graph to the 'X-Intercept' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the Asymptote: Compare the graph to the 'Asymptote' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Calculate the Final Mark: Sum the marks from the three analyses.
Generate the Output: Present your findings in the following strict format. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure for each student.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are three examples of how to apply the rubric and format the output.
Student S1:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph is an increasing function and shows sufficient concave down curvature to be considered a valid logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The intercept is incorrectly labeled as (0,1), which is a y-intercept, not the required x-intercept at (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it, respecting the vertical asymptote.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [1, 0, 1]
Student S6:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The student drew an exponential graph which is concave up, not the required concave down logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through the required x-intercept of (1,0). It passes through a y-intercept instead.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: An exponential graph has a horizontal asymptote, not the required vertical asymptote at x=0. The criterion is not met.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S17:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: Although the graph is somewhat straight, there is a visible attempt at curvature, especially near the ends. Applying the ""benefit of the doubt"" principle, the shape is accepted.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not clearly pass through x=1. While the number '1' is on the axis, the drawn line appears to intersect the axis at a point significantly greater than 1.
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph clearly approaches the y-axis and correctly does not cross into the negative x-region.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [1, 0, 1]
Final Review and System Instruction
After analyzing all students, review your entire response. Before concluding, ensure that for EACH student:
The Final Mark: X/3 line appears exactly once.
The Error Tags: [a,b,c] line appears exactly once, where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1.

Your goal is to grade the following hand-drawn graphs with maximum accuracy and consistency, using the provided rubric and exemplars as your definitive guide.
Rule 0: Foundational Prerequisite
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis clearly visible) to be eligible for any marks.
If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning for each category should state that the property cannot be verified without axes. Do not evaluate any other rules.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
If Rule 0 is met, assess the graph against the following three criteria.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph shows a continuous, gentle curve that is clearly not drawn with a straight edge.
The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear concave down curvature.
The graph connects key points (e.g., (1,0) and (2,1)) with a visible arc, not a straight line. (See Exemplar S7).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear or looks like it was drawn with a ruler, even if slightly wavy. If it appears a student connected two points with a straight line, it is incorrect. (See Exemplar S5).
The graph is concave up (incorrect curvature).
The shape is fundamentally wrong (e.g., exponential, parabolic).
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A dot is placed on the x-axis precisely at the '1' tick mark, and the graph passes through it.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are present):
The graph visibly misses the '1' mark, even if it is close. Ambiguity or clear inaccuracy here results in no mark.
The intercept is not marked at all, or is marked at a different value.
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph clearly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision.
Exemplar Analyses (Based on Problematic Cases)
Use these specific examples as your primary reference for applying the rules.
Exemplar 1: Student S5
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear, appearing to connect the points (1/2, -1) and (1,0) with a straight line. It lacks the required continuous, gentle curve of a logarithmic function.

Exemplar 2: Student S7
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph demonstrates a clear, continuous, gentle curve that is concave down. It is visibly an arc and not a straight line, satisfying the shape requirement.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly marked with a dot and labeled with the coordinate (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis without crossing it.
Final Mark: 3/3

Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).

Your goal is to grade the following hand-drawn graphs with maximum accuracy and consistency, using the provided rubric and exemplars as your definitive guide.
Rule 0: Foundational Prerequisite
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis clearly visible) to be eligible for any marks.
If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning for each category should state that the property cannot be verified without axes. Do not evaluate any other rules.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
If Rule 0 is met, assess the graph against the following three criteria.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph shows a continuous, gentle curve that is clearly not drawn with a straight edge.
The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear concave down curvature.
The graph connects key points (e.g., (1,0) and (2,1)) with a visible arc, not a straight line. (See Exemplar S7).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear or looks like it was drawn with a ruler, even if slightly wavy. If it appears a student connected two points with a straight line, it is incorrect. (See Exemplar S5).
The graph is concave up (incorrect curvature).
The shape is fundamentally wrong (e.g., exponential, parabolic).
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A dot is placed on the x-axis precisely at the '1' tick mark, and the graph passes through it.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are present):
The graph visibly misses the '1' mark, even if it is close. Ambiguity or clear inaccuracy here results in no mark.
The intercept is not marked at all, or is marked at a different value.
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph clearly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision.
Exemplar Analyses (Based on Problematic Cases)
Use these specific examples as your primary reference for applying the rules.
Exemplar 1: Student S5
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear, appearing to connect the points (1/2, -1) and (1,0) with a straight line. It lacks the required continuous, gentle curve of a logarithmic function.

Your goal is to grade hand-drawn graphs accurately and consistently based on the provided memorandum and student work. Adhere to the following principles:
Precision over Guesswork: Follow the provided rubric strictly. Do not infer student intent unless the rubric explicitly allows it.
Benefit of the Doubt (BoD): These are hand-drawn sketches. For ambiguous cases (e.g., a shaky line, a curve that isn't perfectly smooth), err on the side of awarding the mark unless a clear conceptual error is visible.
Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for correctness and leniency.
Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).

Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.

Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing (it goes up as it moves from left to right).
The graph displays clear concave down curvature (it bends downwards like an arch). A slight but noticeable curve is sufficient.
The graph becomes steeper as it approaches the y-axis from the right.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is perfectly linear (a straight line). Exception: If there is a slight, noticeable attempt at a curve, award the mark under the BoD principle.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape).
The graph resembles an exponential function (e.g., y=a^x) or any other incorrect function type.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value (e.g., 2, -1, or on the y-axis).
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
The graph line ends before reaching the y-axis.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The line clearly and deliberately extends into the second or third quadrants (where x < 0).
Leniency Rule: If the line gets very close to or appears to ""smudge"" onto the y-axis due to pencil artifacts or hand-drawn imprecision, award the mark. The deduction is reserved for clear conceptual errors.
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, you must follow this exact procedure and format.
Analyze the Shape: Compare the graph to the 'Shape' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the X-Intercept: Compare the graph to the 'X-Intercept' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the Asymptote: Compare the graph to the 'Asymptote' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Calculate the Final Mark: Sum the marks from the three analyses.
Generate the Output: Present your findings in the following strict format. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure for each student.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are three examples of how to apply the rubric and format the output.
Student S1:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph is an increasing function and shows sufficient concave down curvature to be considered a valid logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The intercept is incorrectly labeled as (0,1), which is a y-intercept, not the required x-intercept at (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it, respecting the vertical asymptote.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [1, 0, 1]
Student S6:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The student drew an exponential graph which is concave up, not the required concave down logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through the required x-intercept of (1,0). It passes through a y-intercept instead.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: An exponential graph has a horizontal asymptote, not the required vertical asymptote at x=0. The criterion is not met.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S17:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: Although the graph is somewhat straight, there is a visible attempt at curvature, especially near the ends. Applying the ""benefit of the doubt"" principle, the shape is accepted.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not clearly pass through x=1. While the number '1' is on the axis, the drawn line appears to intersect the axis at a point significantly greater than 1.
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph clearly approaches the y-axis and correctly does not cross into the negative x-region.
Final Mark: 2/3

Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.

Your goal is to grade the following hand-drawn graphs with maximum accuracy and consistency, using the provided rubric and exemplars as your definitive guide.
Rule 0: Foundational Prerequisite
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis clearly visible) to be eligible for any marks.
If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning for each category should state that the property cannot be verified without axes. Do not evaluate any other rules.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
If Rule 0 is met, assess the graph against the following three criteria.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph shows a continuous, gentle curve that is clearly not drawn with a straight edge.
The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear concave down curvature.
The graph connects key points (e.g., (1,0) and (2,1)) with a visible arc, not a straight line. (See Exemplar S7).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear or looks like it was drawn with a ruler, even if slightly wavy. If it appears a student connected two points with a straight line, it is incorrect. (See Exemplar S5).
The graph is concave up (incorrect curvature).
The shape is fundamentally wrong (e.g., exponential, parabolic).
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A dot is placed on the x-axis precisely at the '1' tick mark, and the graph passes through it.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are present):
The graph visibly misses the '1' mark, even if it is close. Ambiguity or clear inaccuracy here results in no mark.
The intercept is not marked at all, or is marked at a different value.
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph clearly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision.
Exemplar Analyses (Based on Problematic Cases)
Use these specific examples as your primary reference for applying the rules.
Exemplar 1: Student S5
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear, appearing to connect the points (1/2, -1) and (1,0) with a straight line. It lacks the required continuous, gentle curve of a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly and clearly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Exemplar 2: Student S7
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph demonstrates a clear, continuous, gentle curve that is concave down. It is visibly an arc and not a straight line, satisfying the shape requirement.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly marked with a dot and labeled with the coordinate (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis without crossing it.
Final Mark: 3/3
Error Tags: [1, 1, 1]
Exemplar 3: Student S24
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational Prerequisite (Rule 0) failed. No Cartesian axes are drawn, so the graph's properties cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: Rule 0 failed. No axes are drawn.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: Rule 0 failed. No axes are drawn.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Final Instructions
For each student, first check Rule 0. If it fails, assign 0/3 and stop.
If Rule 0 passes, evaluate Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote strictly according to the rubric and exemplars.

Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing (it goes up as it moves from left to right).
The graph displays clear concave down curvature (it bends downwards like an arch). A slight but noticeable curve is sufficient.
The graph becomes steeper as it approaches the y-axis from the right.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is perfectly linear (a straight line). Exception: If there is a slight, noticeable attempt at a curve, award the mark under the BoD principle.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape).
The graph resembles an exponential function (e.g., y=a^x) or any other incorrect function type.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value (e.g., 2, -1, or on the y-axis).
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
The graph line ends before reaching the y-axis.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The line clearly and deliberately extends into the second or third quadrants (where x < 0).
Leniency Rule: If the line gets very close to or appears to ""smudge"" onto the y-axis due to pencil artifacts or hand-drawn imprecision, award the mark. The deduction is reserved for clear conceptual errors.
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, you must follow this exact procedure and format.
Analyze the Shape: Compare the graph to the 'Shape' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the X-Intercept: Compare the graph to the 'X-Intercept' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the Asymptote: Compare the graph to the 'Asymptote' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Calculate the Final Mark: Sum the marks from the three analyses.
Generate the Output: Present your findings in the following strict format. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure for each student.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are three examples of how to apply the rubric and format the output.
Student S1:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph is an increasing function and shows sufficient concave down curvature to be considered a valid logarithmic shape.

Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.

Your goal is to grade the following hand-drawn graphs with maximum accuracy and consistency, using the provided rubric and exemplars as your definitive guide.
Rule 0: Foundational Prerequisite
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis clearly visible) to be eligible for any marks.
If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning for each category should state that the property cannot be verified without axes. Do not evaluate any other rules.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
If Rule 0 is met, assess the graph against the following three criteria.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph shows a continuous, gentle curve that is clearly not drawn with a straight edge.
The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear concave down curvature.
The graph connects key points (e.g., (1,0) and (2,1)) with a visible arc, not a straight line. (See Exemplar S7).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear or looks like it was drawn with a ruler, even if slightly wavy. If it appears a student connected two points with a straight line, it is incorrect. (See Exemplar S5).
The graph is concave up (incorrect curvature).
The shape is fundamentally wrong (e.g., exponential, parabolic).
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A dot is placed on the x-axis precisely at the '1' tick mark, and the graph passes through it.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are present):
The graph visibly misses the '1' mark, even if it is close. Ambiguity or clear inaccuracy here results in no mark.
The intercept is not marked at all, or is marked at a different value.
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph clearly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision.
Exemplar Analyses (Based on Problematic Cases)
Use these specific examples as your primary reference for applying the rules.
Exemplar 1: Student S5
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear, appearing to connect the points (1/2, -1) and (1,0) with a straight line. It lacks the required continuous, gentle curve of a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly and clearly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Exemplar 2: Student S7
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph demonstrates a clear, continuous, gentle curve that is concave down. It is visibly an arc and not a straight line, satisfying the shape requirement.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly marked with a dot and labeled with the coordinate (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis without crossing it.
Final Mark: 3/3
Error Tags: [1, 1, 1]
Exemplar 3: Student S24
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational Prerequisite (Rule 0) failed. No Cartesian axes are drawn, so the graph's properties cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: Rule 0 failed. No axes are drawn.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: Rule 0 failed. No axes are drawn.
Final Mark: 0/3

Final Instructions
For each student, first check Rule 0. If it fails, assign 0/3 and stop.
If Rule 0 passes, evaluate Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote strictly according to the rubric and exemplars.

Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every single graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for leniency and correctness.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing (it goes up as it moves from left to right).
The graph displays clear concave down curvature (it bends downwards like an arch). A slight but noticeable curve is sufficient.
The graph becomes steeper as it approaches the y-axis from the right.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is perfectly linear (a straight line). Exception: If there is a slight, noticeable attempt at a curve, award the mark under the BoD principle.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape).
The graph resembles an exponential function (e.g., y=a^x) or any other incorrect function type.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value (e.g., 2, -1, or on the y-axis).
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
The graph line ends before reaching the y-axis.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The line clearly and deliberately extends into the second or third quadrants (where x < 0).
Leniency Rule: If the line gets very close to or appears to ""smudge"" onto the y-axis due to pencil artifacts or hand-drawn imprecision, award the mark. The deduction is reserved for clear conceptual errors.
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, you must follow this exact procedure and format.
Analyze the Shape: Compare the graph to the 'Shape' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the X-Intercept: Compare the graph to the 'X-Intercept' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the Asymptote: Compare the graph to the 'Asymptote' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Calculate the Final Mark: Sum the marks from the three analyses.
Generate the Output: Present your findings in the following strict format. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure for each student.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are three examples of how to apply the rubric and format the output.
Student S1:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph is an increasing function and shows sufficient concave down curvature to be considered a valid logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The intercept is incorrectly labeled as (0,1), which is a y-intercept, not the required x-intercept at (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it, respecting the vertical asymptote.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [1, 0, 1]
Student S6:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The student drew an exponential graph which is concave up, not the required concave down logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through the required x-intercept of (1,0). It passes through a y-intercept instead.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: An exponential graph has a horizontal asymptote, not the required vertical asymptote at x=0. The criterion is not met.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S17:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: Although the graph is somewhat straight, there is a visible attempt at curvature, especially near the ends. Applying the ""benefit of the doubt"" principle, the shape is accepted.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not clearly pass through x=1. While the number '1' is on the axis, the drawn line appears to intersect the axis at a point significantly greater than 1.
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph clearly approaches the y-axis and correctly does not cross into the negative x-region.

The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.

X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through the required x-intercept of (1,0). It passes through a y-intercept instead.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: An exponential graph has a horizontal asymptote, not the required vertical asymptote at x=0. The criterion is not met.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S17:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: Although the graph is somewhat straight, there is a visible attempt at curvature, especially near the ends. Applying the ""benefit of the doubt"" principle, the shape is accepted.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not clearly pass through x=1. While the number '1' is on the axis, the drawn line appears to intersect the axis at a point significantly greater than 1.
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph clearly approaches the y-axis and correctly does not cross into the negative x-region.

Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]

Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.

Your goal is to grade the following hand-drawn graphs with maximum accuracy and consistency, using the provided rubric and exemplars as your definitive guide.
Rule 0: Foundational Prerequisite
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis clearly visible) to be eligible for any marks.
If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning for each category should state that the property cannot be verified without axes. Do not evaluate any other rules.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
If Rule 0 is met, assess the graph against the following three criteria.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph shows a continuous, gentle curve that is clearly not drawn with a straight edge.
The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear concave down curvature.
The graph connects key points (e.g., (1,0) and (2,1)) with a visible arc, not a straight line. (See Exemplar S7).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear or looks like it was drawn with a ruler, even if slightly wavy. If it appears a student connected two points with a straight line, it is incorrect. (See Exemplar S5).
The graph is concave up (incorrect curvature).
The shape is fundamentally wrong (e.g., exponential, parabolic).
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A dot is placed on the x-axis precisely at the '1' tick mark, and the graph passes through it.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are present):
The graph visibly misses the '1' mark, even if it is close. Ambiguity or clear inaccuracy here results in no mark.
The intercept is not marked at all, or is marked at a different value.
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph clearly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision.

Exemplar 2: Student S7
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph demonstrates a clear, continuous, gentle curve that is concave down. It is visibly an arc and not a straight line, satisfying the shape requirement.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly marked with a dot and labeled with the coordinate (1,0).

The graph displays clear concave down curvature (it bends downwards like an arch). A slight but noticeable curve is sufficient.
The graph becomes steeper as it approaches the y-axis from the right.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is perfectly linear (a straight line). Exception: If there is a slight, noticeable attempt at a curve, award the mark under the BoD principle.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape).
The graph resembles an exponential function (e.g., y=a^x) or any other incorrect function type.

The intercept is clearly at a different x-value (e.g., 2, -1, or on the y-axis).
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
The graph line ends before reaching the y-axis.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The line clearly and deliberately extends into the second or third quadrants (where x < 0).
Leniency Rule: If the line gets very close to or appears to ""smudge"" onto the y-axis due to pencil artifacts or hand-drawn imprecision, award the mark. The deduction is reserved for clear conceptual errors.
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, you must follow this exact procedure and format.
Analyze the Shape: Compare the graph to the 'Shape' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the X-Intercept: Compare the graph to the 'X-Intercept' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Analyze the Asymptote: Compare the graph to the 'Asymptote' rubric. State your conclusion and provide a brief reason.
Calculate the Final Mark: Sum the marks from the three analyses.
Generate the Output: Present your findings in the following strict format. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure for each student.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are three examples of how to apply the rubric and format the output.
Student S1:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph is an increasing function and shows sufficient concave down curvature to be considered a valid logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The intercept is incorrectly labeled as (0,1), which is a y-intercept, not the required x-intercept at (1,0).

Student S6:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The student drew an exponential graph which is concave up, not the required concave down logarithmic shape.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through the required x-intercept of (1,0). It passes through a y-intercept instead.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: An exponential graph has a horizontal asymptote, not the required vertical asymptote at x=0. The criterion is not met.
Final Mark: 0/3
