Student S1:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is concave up (bending upwards), which is the incorrect curvature for the required logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The intercept is incorrectly labeled as (0,1), which is a y-intercept. The graph does not pass through the required x-intercept at (1,0).
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph crosses the y-axis, showing no vertical asymptote at x=0. The shape resembles an exponential function, which has the incorrect asymptote type.

Student S8:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is drawn as a series of connected straight line segments, not a smooth curve. This does not demonstrate an understanding of the function's curvature.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not intercept the x-axis at all.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not approach the y-axis; it starts at x=1, so the required asymptotic behavior is not shown.

Student S10:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph is an increasing function and shows clear concave down curvature.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The intercept point on the x-axis is not correctly labeled. A nearby point is labeled (1/2, -1), but the intercept itself lacks the required (1,0) label or the number '1' on the axis.
