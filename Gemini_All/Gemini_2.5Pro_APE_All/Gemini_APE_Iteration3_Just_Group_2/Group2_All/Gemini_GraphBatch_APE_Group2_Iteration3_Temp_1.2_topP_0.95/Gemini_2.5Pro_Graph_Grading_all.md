Here is the grading for each student's graph.

### Student S1
*   **Shape (Vorm): 0/1**
    *   Reason: The graph is composed of distinct linear segments, not a continuous, gentle curve. This is similar to the error in Exemplar S5.
*   **X-Intercept (x-afsnit): 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph passes clearly and accurately through the '1' tick mark on the x-axis.
*   **Asymptote: 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends without crossing into the negative x-quadrants.

**Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]**
***
### Student S2
*   **Shape (Vorm): 1/1**
