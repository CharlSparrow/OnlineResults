Grading in progress. Applying the provided rubric and exemplars to each student's graph.

### Student S1
*   **Shape (Vorm): 0/1**
    *   Reason: The graph is not a continuous curve. It is drawn as a series of straight line segments, which is fundamentally incorrect for a logarithmic function. This is similar to the error in Exemplar S5.
*   **X-Intercept (x-afsnit): 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph passes correctly through the tick mark for '1' on the x-axis.
*   **Asymptote: 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends without crossing into the negative x-quadrants.

**Final Mark: 2/3**
**Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]**
***
### Student S2
*   **Shape (Vorm): 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph is a continuous, gentle curve that is strictly increasing and concave down, satisfying all shape requirements.
*   **X-Intercept (x-afsnit): 1/1**
    *   Reason: The x-intercept is clearly and correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
*   **Asymptote: 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing.

**Final Mark: 3/3**

### Student S11

### Student S12

    *   Reason: The graph is a continuous curve that is increasing and concave down. The shape is correct.
*   **X-Intercept (x-afsnit): 0/1**

*   **Asymptote: 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right. It gets very close, and the leniency rule for minor smudging applies.
