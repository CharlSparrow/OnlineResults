### Student S1
- **Shape (Vorm): 0/1.** Reason: The graph is composed of straight line segments, not a continuous, gentle curve. This is analogous to the "predominantly linear" negative indicator in Exemplar S5.

- **Asymptote: 1/1.** Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends without crossing.
