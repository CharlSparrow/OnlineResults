Grading complete. Here is the assessment for each student.

***
### Student S1
- **Shape (Vorm):** 0/1. Reason: The graph is composed of straight line segments and is not a continuous, gentle curve. This is a clear example of a "predominantly linear" graph, similar to Exemplar S5.
- **X-Intercept (x-afsnit):** 1/1. Reason: The graph passes clearly through the tick mark for '1' on the x-axis.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
- **Final Mark:** 2/3
- **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]
***
### Student S2
- **Shape (Vorm):** 1/1. Reason: The graph demonstrates a clear, continuous, gentle curve that is strictly increasing and concave down.
