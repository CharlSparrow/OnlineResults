Here is the grading for each student's graph.

### Student S1
*   **Shape (Vorm):** 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear, composed of straight line segments. It lacks the required continuous, gentle curve of a logarithmic function. This is similar to Exemplar S5.

*   **Asymptote:** 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.

*   **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]

### Student S2
*   **Shape (Vorm):** 1/1. Reason: The graph demonstrates a clear, continuous, gentle curve that is strictly increasing and concave down.
