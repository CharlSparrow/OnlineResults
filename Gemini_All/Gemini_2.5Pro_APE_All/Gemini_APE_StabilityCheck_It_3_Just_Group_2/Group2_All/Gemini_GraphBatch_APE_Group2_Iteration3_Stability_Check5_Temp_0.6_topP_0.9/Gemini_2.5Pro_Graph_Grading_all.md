Excellent. As an expert mathematics teaching assistant, I will grade each graph with maximum accuracy and consistency, strictly adhering to the provided rubric and exemplars.

### Grading Student S1
*   **Shape (Vorm): 0/1**
    *   Reason: The graph is not a continuous, gentle curve. It is drawn as a series of connected straight line segments, which is incorrect for a logarithmic function. This is similar to the negative indicator described for Exemplar S5.
*   **X-Intercept (x-afsnit): 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph passes clearly and precisely through the '1' tick mark on the x-axis.
*   **Asymptote: 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.

*   **Final Mark: 2/3**
*   **Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]**

---
### Grading Student S2
*   **Shape (Vorm): 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph displays a continuous, gentle curve that is strictly increasing and concave down, satisfying all positive indicators for shape.

    *   Reason: The x-intercept is clearly and correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
*   **Asymptote: 1/1**
    *   Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right and descends without crossing into the negative x-quadrants.

*   **Final Mark: 3/3**
*   **Error Tags: [1, 1, 1]**

### Grading Student S6
*   **Shape (Vorm): 0/1**
    *   Reason: The shape is fundamentally wrong. Two separate graphs are drawn, neither of which represents the required strictly increasing logarithmic function.

*   **Error Tags: [1, 1, 1]**

---
### Grading Student S8

---
### Grading Student S11

    *   Reason: The graph does not pass through the required x-intercept at (1,0).

*   **Final Mark: 0/3**
*   **Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]**

### Grading Student S19
*   **Shape (Vorm): 0/1**
