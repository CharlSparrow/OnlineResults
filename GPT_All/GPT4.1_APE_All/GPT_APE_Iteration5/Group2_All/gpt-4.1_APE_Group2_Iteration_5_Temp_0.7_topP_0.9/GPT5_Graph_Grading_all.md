Student 1  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): none; Accepted for B: none (dot at x=1, tick labeled "1" at intercept).  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, left end much steeper than right, steep-to-flat.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: C=1 because the curve is monotone increasing, concave down, and steep-to-flat as x increases.  
• x-intercept: B=1 as there is a clearly labeled dot at x=1 on the x-axis with a nearby "1".  
• Asymptote: A=1 as the curve stays entirely in x>0, does not touch or cross y-axis.
