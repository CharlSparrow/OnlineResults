Student 1  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): none, dot at x=1 with clear “1” label; Accepted for B: [dot at x=1 with “1” label].  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, left end steeper, right tail flattens.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: C=1 because the curve is monotone increasing, concave down, steep-to-flat, matching log₂(x).  
• x-intercept: B=1 as the dot at x=1 is labeled “1” and is on h⁻¹.  
• Asymptote: A=1, as the curve stays in x>0 and does not touch/overlap y-axis except for line thickness.
