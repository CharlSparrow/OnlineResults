• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): none; Accepted for B: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, steeper left tail, flattening right.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: C=1 because the h⁻¹ curve is monotone increasing, concave down, and visibly steeper on the left.  
• x-intercept: B=0 because there is no “(1;0)”, “x=1”, or labeled dot at x≈1 attached to the h⁻¹ curve.  
• Asymptote: A=1 because the curve stays entirely in x>0 and does not cross/touch y-axis except perhaps by thickness.
