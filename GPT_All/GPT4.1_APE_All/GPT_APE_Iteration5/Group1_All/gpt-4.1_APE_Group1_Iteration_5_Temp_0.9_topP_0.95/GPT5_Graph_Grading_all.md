Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): “(0;1)”, “(½;−1)”, “(2;1)”; Accepted for B: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, steep left, flat right.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: C=1 because curve is monotone increasing, concave down, and steeper left than right.  
• x-intercept: B=0 because no acceptable (1;0)/x=1/labeled dot at x≈1 is attached to h⁻¹.  
• Asymptote: A=1 because the curve stays entirely in x>0 (no segment left of axis).
