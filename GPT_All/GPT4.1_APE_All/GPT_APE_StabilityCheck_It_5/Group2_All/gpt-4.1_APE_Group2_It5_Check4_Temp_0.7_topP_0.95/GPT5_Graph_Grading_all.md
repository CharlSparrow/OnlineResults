Student 1  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): none.  
• Accepted for B: unlabeled dot at x=1, tick labeled “1” nearby.  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, left end steep, right end flattens.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: C=1 because the curve is monotone increasing, concave down, steep to flat, matches log shape.  
• x-intercept: B=1 because the crossing at x≈1 is marked with a nearby “1” tick and dot.  
• Asymptote: A=1 because the entire curve remains in x>0, no left-of-axis segment.
