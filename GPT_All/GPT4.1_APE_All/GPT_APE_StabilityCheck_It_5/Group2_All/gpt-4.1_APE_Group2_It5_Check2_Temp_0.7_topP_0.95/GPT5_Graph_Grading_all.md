Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): none; Accepted for B: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, left end steeper than right, right tail flattens.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: C=1 because the curve is monotone increasing, concave down, with a steep-to-flat pattern.  
• x-intercept: B=0 because there is no explicit (1;0), "x=1", or labeled dot at x≈1 attached to the h⁻¹ curve.  
• Asymptote: A=1 because the curve stays entirely in x>0 (no continuous segment left of y-axis).

ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: no (but only one plausible curve).

• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): "(1;0)"; Accepted for B: ["(1;0)"].  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, steep-to-flat pattern.  
Reasons:

Student 6  
Mark: `0/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 2; h⁻¹ label: yes.
