Here are the grades for students S1–S26 according to the provided rubric and exemplars:

---

**S1**  
- Shape: 0/1. The graph is predominantly linear, connecting points mostly with straight lines, similar to S5. Lacks the required gentle curve.

---

**S2**  
- Shape: 1/1. Shows a continuous, gentle curve, concave down, not linear.
