Let's grade each student using the provided rubric and exemplars:

---

**S1**
- Shape: 0/1. The graph is predominantly linear between points, connecting with straight segments rather than a gentle, continuous logarithmic arc. (Similar to S5 in the exemplars.)
- X-Intercept: 1/1. There is a dot exactly at (1,0) and it is labeled.
- Asymptote: 1/1. The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right and does not cross into the negative x.
- Final Mark: 2/3  
- Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]

---

**S2**
- Shape: 1/1. The curve is smooth, continuous, and concave down (appropriate log shape).
- X-Intercept: 1/1. The point (1,0) is labeled and marked clearly.
- Asymptote: 1/1. The graph approaches the y-axis from the right and does not cross it.

---

**S3**
- Shape: 1/1. The curve is smooth, increasing, and concave down as needed.
