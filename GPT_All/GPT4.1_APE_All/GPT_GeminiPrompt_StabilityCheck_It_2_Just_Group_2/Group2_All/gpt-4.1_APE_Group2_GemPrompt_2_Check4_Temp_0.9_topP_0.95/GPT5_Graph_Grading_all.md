Here are the grades for all 26 students, following the rubric and exemplars precisely:

---

**S1**
- Shape: 0/1. The graph is predominantly linear, appearing to connect marked points with straight lines rather than a gentle, continuous curve. This matches the issue seen in S5.
- X-Intercept: 1/1. The graph passes through and marks the point (1,0).
- Asymptote: 1/1. The graph approaches the y-axis from the right and does not cross.
- **Final Mark:** 2/3  
- **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]

---

**S2**
- Shape: 1/1. The curve is gentle and concave down, clearly not linear.
- X-Intercept: 1/1. The point (1,0) is marked and passed through.
- Asymptote: 1/1. Approaches y-axis without crossing.
- **Final Mark:** 3/3  
- **Error Tags:** [1, 1, 1]

---

**S3**
- Shape: 1/1. The graph shows a continuous, concave down curve.
- X-Intercept: 1/1. (1,0) is marked and the graph passes through it.

- **Final Mark:** 3/3  
- **Error Tags:** [1, 1, 1]

---

**S4**
- Shape: 1/1. The curve is continuous, gentle, and concave down.

---

**S5**
- Shape: 0/1. The graph is predominantly linear, connecting points with a straight segment, as per the S5 exemplar.

- **Final Mark:** 2/3  
- **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]

---

**S6**
- Shape: 0/1. The target graph is present but so is an exponential curve, suggesting confusion. This is not a single continuous gentle curve as required.

- Asymptote: 1/1. The logarithmic curve does approach the y-axis.
