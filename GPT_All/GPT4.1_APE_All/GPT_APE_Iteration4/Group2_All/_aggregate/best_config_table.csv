Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.
