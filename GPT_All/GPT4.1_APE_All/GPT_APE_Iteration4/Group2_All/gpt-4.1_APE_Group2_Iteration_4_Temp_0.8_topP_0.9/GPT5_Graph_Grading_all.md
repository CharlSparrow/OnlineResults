Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is almost linear with very little visible curvature, lacking the steep-to-flat transition of a logarithmic shape.  
• x-intercept: There is no explicit “(1;0)”/“x=1”/labeled dot at x≈1; only a dot and crossing with no label, so no evidence for B.
