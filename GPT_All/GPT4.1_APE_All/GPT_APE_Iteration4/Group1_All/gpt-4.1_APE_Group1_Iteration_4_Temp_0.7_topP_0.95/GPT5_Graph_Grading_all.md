Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [0/1,0/1,1/1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing and concave down over most of its visible branch, but the left end does not clearly approach the y-axis more steeply than the right end.  
• x-intercept: No explicit evidence of (1;0), x=1, or a labeled dot at x=1 is present.  
• Asymptote: The entire curve stays strictly in x>0, never touching or crossing the y-axis.
