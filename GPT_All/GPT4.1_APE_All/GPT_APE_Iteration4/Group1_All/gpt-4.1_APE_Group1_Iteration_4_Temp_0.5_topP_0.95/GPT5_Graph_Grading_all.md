Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing but is not concave down over most of its branch, so C=0.  
• x-intercept: No explicit “(1;0)”, “x=1”, or labeled dot at x≈1 is present, so B=0.  
• Asymptote: The entire curve stays strictly in x>0, so A=1.

Student 2  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing, concave down, and shows the steep-to-flat pattern, so C=1.  
• x-intercept: The explicit label “(1;0)” appears on the page, so B=1.  
• Asymptote: The curve stays strictly in x>0, so A=1.

Student 3  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,0]  
Reasons:
