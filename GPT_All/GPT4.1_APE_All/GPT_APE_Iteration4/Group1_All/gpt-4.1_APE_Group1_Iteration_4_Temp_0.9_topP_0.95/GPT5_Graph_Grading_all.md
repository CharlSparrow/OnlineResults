Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,0]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing and concave down, with a steeper left end and flatter right, matching logarithmic shape.  
• x-intercept: There is no explicit evidence for (1;0), "x=1", or a labeled dot at x=1.  
• Asymptote: The curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, violating the strict x>0 requirement.

Student 2  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing and concave down, with the left end steeper and heading downward, then flattens to the right.

• Asymptote: The entire curve stays strictly in x>0 with no overlap or running along the y-axis.

Student 3  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  
Reasons:

Student 6  
Mark: `0/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]  
Reasons:

Student 8  
Mark: `0/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]  
Reasons:

Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,0]  
Reasons:

• x-intercept: No explicit "(1;0)", "x=1", or labeled dot at x=1.  
• Asymptote: The visible curve starts away from and does not approach the y-axis, so fails the asymptote requirement for h⁻¹.

ErrorTags: [0,0,0]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: There are no axes present, so no assessment of curve shape is valid.

• Asymptote: No axes present, so assign 0 for asymptote automatically.

Reasons:  
• Shape: There are no axes present, so no assessment of curve shape is valid.

ErrorTags: [0,0,0]  
Reasons:
