Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing but lacks visible concave-down (logarithmic) shape, appearing almost straight on the upper branch.  
• x-intercept: No explicit “(1;0)”/“x=1”/labeled dot at x≈1; only “(0;1)” and “(½;−1)” are labeled.  
• Asymptote: The entire curve stays strictly in x>0 and does not touch or cross the y-axis.

Student 2  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The h⁻¹ curve is monotone increasing, concave down, and shows the left end steep and downward, right end flattening.  
• x-intercept: The text “(1;0)” is explicitly labeled near the curve.  
• Asymptote: The curve stays entirely in x>0, not touching or crossing the y-axis.

Student 3  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing, concave down, and has the correct steep-to-flat left/right behavior.  
• x-intercept: The point “(1;0)” is labeled, but no dot or clear marking at x=1, and the label is a bit ambiguous; however, it is near enough to accept as explicit evidence.  
• Asymptote: The curve remains strictly in x>0, not touching the y-axis.

Student 4  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:

ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:
