Here is the grading for students S1–S26 according to your rubric and exemplars:

---

**S1**
- **Shape:** 0/1. The graph is predominantly linear, connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), and (2,1) with nearly straight segments. This matches the issue in Exemplar S5.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. The x-intercept is clearly marked at (1,0) with a dot and label.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. The graph approaches the y-axis from the right and does not cross it.
- **Final Mark:** 2/3  
- **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]

---

**S2**
- **Shape:** 1/1. The graph is a continuous, gentle, concave-down curve, not a straight line.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. The coordinate (1,0) is written at the intercept.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. The curve approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and does not cross it.
- **Final Mark:** 3/3  
- **Error Tags:** [1, 1, 1]

---

**S3**
- **Shape:** 1/1. The curve is gentle, continuous, and concave down as required.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. The point (1,0) is labeled and marked on the x-axis.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. The graph approaches the y-axis from the right and does not cross it.
- **Final Mark:** 3/3  
- **Error Tags:** [1, 1, 1]

---

**S4**
- **Shape:** 1/1. The curve is gentle, continuous, and concave down.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. The intercept is clearly at (1,0), marked and labeled.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. The curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
- **Final Mark:** 3/3

---

**S5**
- **Shape:** 0/1. The curve is predominantly linear (matches Exemplar S5).

- **Final Mark:** 2/3  
- **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]

---

**S6**
- **Shape:** 0/1. The answer includes two graphs, one of which is not the logarithmic curve. The correct curve is present but the other (labelled 'h') is an increasing exponential. The presence of both is confusing and does not fulfill the required "single curve" property.
- **X-Intercept:** 0/1. The logarithmic curve does not clearly mark or label the x-intercept at (1,0); (1/2, -1) is labeled, but the intercept is not emphasized.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. The logarithmic graph does approach the y-axis from the right and does not cross.
