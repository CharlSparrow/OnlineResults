Let's grade all 26 students according to the rubric and exemplars provided.

---

**S1**  
- **Axes present:** Yes (Rule 0 passed)
- **Shape:** 0/1. The graph is predominantly linear, connecting (1/2,-1), (1,0), (2,1), and (4,2) mostly with straight segments rather than a gentle, continuous curve. This matches the negative indicator in Exemplar S5.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. The x-intercept at (1,0) is clearly labeled and the graph passes through it.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. The curve approaches the y-axis from the right and does not cross.
- **Final Mark:** 2/3  
- **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]

---

**S2**  
- **Axes present:** Yes
- **Shape:** 1/1. The graph is a smooth, concave-down curve connecting the key points and not linear. Matches positive indicators.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. The intercept (1,0) is labeled and the graph passes through it.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. The graph approaches the y-axis from the right and does not cross.
- **Final Mark:** 3/3  
- **Error Tags:** [1, 1, 1]

---

**S3**  
- **Axes present:** Yes
- **Shape:** 1/1. Smooth, concave down, continuous curve.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. Labeled (1,0) and passes through.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. Approaches y-axis from the right, does not cross.
- **Final Mark:** 3/3  
- **Error Tags:** [1, 1, 1]

---

**S4**  
- **Axes present:** Yes
- **Shape:** 1/1. Smooth, gentle, concave-down curve.
- **X-Intercept:** 1/1. (1,0) labeled and correct.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. Approaches y-axis as required.
- **Final Mark:** 3/3

---

**S5**  
- **Axes present:** Yes
- **Shape:** 0/1. The line between (1/2,-1) and (1,0) is too straight, nearly linear—matches S5 example.

- **Asymptote:** 1/1. Approaches y-axis, does not cross.
- **Final Mark:** 2/3  
- **Error Tags:** [0, 1, 1]

---

**S6**  
- **Axes present:** Yes
- **Shape:** 0/1. Two curves are drawn; the one labeled h^-1 is correct, but another function is present, making it ambiguous and not strictly a single gentle, concave-down curve.
- **X-Intercept:** 0/1. The x-intercept is not clearly marked for the inverse logarithm; dots and labels are ambiguous.
- **Asymptote:** 1/1. h^-1 approaches the y-axis without crossing.
- **Final Mark:** 1/3  
- **Error Tags:** [0, 0, 1]

---

**S7**  
- **Axes present:** Yes
