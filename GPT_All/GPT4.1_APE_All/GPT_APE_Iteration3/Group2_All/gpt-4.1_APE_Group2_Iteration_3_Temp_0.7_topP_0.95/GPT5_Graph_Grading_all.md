Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is mostly increasing and concave down, although the midsection is a bit straight, both ends bend correctly.  
• x-intercept: There is no explicit “(1;0)” or “x=1” text or a labeled dot at x=1, so this check is not awarded.  
• Asymptote: The curve never clearly crosses into x<0, so the asymptote is respected.

Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:
