Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis because of line thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels and faint guidelines/erasures; those are not the curve.
  • A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
  • DEDUCT only when a continuous part of the drawn curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
  • AWARD only if at least ONE of the following appears:
    – the coordinate text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, or
    – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, or
    – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby “1” label.
  • DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis, a “1” written near the axis without a dot,
    a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis, “(0;1)”, “(½;−1)”, “2”, ticks, or generic marks.
  • Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.

Check C — Log shape (base >1)
  • AWARD if the main curve is overall increasing and concave down (steep near x→0⁺, flatter to the right).
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if the ends bend and it is monotone increasing, AWARD (S17/S1-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

PREREQUISITES (axes handling)
  • If EITHER axis is missing or not drawn (no visible coordinate axes), set A=0 and B=0.
    Shape (C) may still be awarded if the curve alone clearly looks like a log; otherwise C=0.
    (Max possible without axes is 1/3.)

MULTIPLE CURVES
  • Only grade the intended inverse log curve. If several curves appear, use the one labeled “h⁻¹”;
    otherwise choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in the first quadrant neighborhood.
  • Do not use markings/labels from other curves (“h”, exponential distractors) to award any check.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
  • Never infer B from shape/crossing alone. Missing the explicit tokens above → B=0.
  • 1/3 should be rare: use it when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds (common case: axes absent → only C may hold).

WHAT TO IGNORE
  • Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, arrowheads, axis ticks, and faint guidelines.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (required before deciding)
• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.
  – Curve count on the axes: <number>; h⁻¹ label present? <yes/no>.
  – Left-of-y evidence: “none / tiny nib / continuous segment length≈<…>”.
  – X-intercept tokens (quote verbatim in order): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
  – Accepted for B (and why attached to h⁻¹): <list/none>.
  – Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
• If you cannot quote an acceptable token for B, set B=0. If you cannot rule out left-of-axis contact except for smudge/thickness, AWARD A.

CONSISTENCY CHECK (must pass)
• ErrorTags must be [shape(C), x_intercept(B), asymptote(A)] as 0/1.
• Mark must equal the sum of ErrorTags (0–3). If not, adjust the mark to match the tags.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from crossing alone. Without an acceptable token, B=0.

You are grading hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2). Use the attached memorandum drawing as ground truth. Grade each student independently. Follow the rubric exactly. Output must follow the schema below with no extra prose or headers.

RUBRIC (apply in this order; each awarded = 1 mark; total out of 3)
A. ASYMPTOTE (y-axis at x=0)
   • Award if the drawn curve does NOT clearly cross the y-axis.
   • Touching or brushing the axis counts as NOT crossing.
   • Axis ticks, labels, or arrowheads are NOT the curve.
   • Deduct only when a visible part of the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.

B. X-INTERCEPT at (1;0)
   • Award if any of the following are present near x≈1 on the x-axis:
     (i) a dot with a nearby “1” label,
     (ii) the coordinate (1;0) or (1,0),
     (iii) “x=1”.
   • x-intercept tolerance: treat markings from x=0.8 to x=1.2 as at x=1.
   • Do NOT infer the intercept from curve shape alone if there is no dot/label/crossing.

C. SHAPE of a log curve with base >1
   • Award if the main curve is increasing and concave down, with a steep left tail as x→0⁺ and a slowly rising right tail.
   • The curve may be rough; if it shows some curvature at the ends and is overall increasing, award (borderline S17-type drawings qualify).
   • Deduct if the drawing is obviously an exponential (concave up), a straight line with no curvature, or decreasing.

AMBIGUITY POLICY
• For A and B: if ambiguous, AWARD.
• For C: award when there is some curvature and monotone increase; otherwise deduct.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, shading, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and stray pencil marks.
• If multiple curves appear, choose the one nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.

STRICT vs RELAXED
• STRICT mark (“Mark”) is the sum of A/B/C decisions above (0–3). ErrorTags must match these decisions exactly.
• RELAXED potential marks (“PotentialMarks”) list all marks that could reasonably be awarded under generous interpretation:
  – award A and/or B if borderline,
  – award C if there is some curvature and monotone increase.
• PotentialMarks must be a sorted list of unique integers from {0,1,2,3} and MUST include the strict mark.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — do not deviate)
For EACH student, output exactly the following block. Use plain text, no markdown. Do not add blank lines between fields other than those shown. Do not echo examples. Do not write “3/3” anywhere except the single Mark line. Do not restate earlier students’ marks.

Student <number>
Mark: `<X>/3`     <-- appears exactly once for this student
ErrorTags: [shape,x_intercept,asymptote] as [0/1,0/1,0/1]
Reasons:
• Shape: <one concise sentence stating why awarded/deducted>
• x-intercept: <one concise sentence>
• Asymptote: <one concise sentence>
PotentialMarks: [<comma-separated integers from {0,1,2,3}>]

NOTES FOR REASONS
• Keep each reason to one sentence, factual and tied to the rubric.
• Use only numerals and standard coordinate forms (e.g., (1;0) or (1,0)) inside the Reasons.
• Never include any additional “/3” strings anywhere in Reasons or PotentialMarks.

IN-CONTEXT EXAMPLES (for understanding only — DO NOT OUTPUT THESE; they use “of” to avoid the “/3” token)
Example A (perfect memo-like)
Student EX-A
Mark: `3 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]
Reasons:
• Shape: Increasing, concave-down log curve matching the memo.
• x-intercept: Dot and label at x=1 on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
PotentialMarks: [3]

Example B (borderline S17-like)
Student EX-B
Mark: `2 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  (or [1,1,1] if it only touches)
Reasons:
• Shape: Mostly straight but bends at ends and is overall increasing, so award shape.
• x-intercept: “1” marked on the x-axis near the crossing at x≈1.
• Asymptote: [state “crosses” if any part lies left of the y-axis; otherwise “does not cross”].
PotentialMarks: [1,2,3]

Example C (exponential S6-like)
Student EX-C
Mark: `0 of 3`
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]
Reasons:
• Shape: Exponential (concave up) rather than logarithmic.
• x-intercept: No valid (1;0) indication on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Drawing not consistent with a log graph’s y-axis asymptote.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For each student 1..26 output exactly the block below — no extra prose, no blank lines.
The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
(two full curves on the same axes; h⁻¹ hugs/runs along y-axis): evidence belongs to other curve(s); h⁻¹ shows hyperbolic behavior and y-axis contact → Shape=0, X=0, Asymptote=0 ⇒ Final 0/3.
(mostly straight, then kicks up; contact at origin or left-of-y): Shape=0 (straight/piecewise & concave-up end); X=0 (no valid token); Asymptote=0 (clear point contact at y-axis/left segment) ⇒ 0/3.
(good memo-like): clear concave-down increase; “(1;0)” marked for h⁻¹; no continuous left-of-axis stroke → 3/3.
(multi-curve; no X token for h⁻¹): even if Shape and Asymptote look okay, X=0 (no acceptable token attached to h⁻¹) ⇒ at most 2/3.
No axes (S24-type): Rule 0 triggers → 0/3.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

Your goal is to grade hand-drawn graphs accurately and consistently based on the provided memorandum and student work. Adhere to the following principles:
Precision over Guesswork: Follow the provided rubric strictly. Do not infer student intent unless the rubric explicitly allows it.
Benefit of the Doubt (BoD): These are hand-drawn sketches. For ambiguous cases (e.g., a shaky line, a curve that isn't perfectly smooth), err on the side of awarding the mark unless a clear conceptual error is visible.
Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for correctness and leniency.
Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Final Review and System Instruction
After analyzing all students, review your entire response. Before concluding, ensure that for EACH student:
The Final Mark: X/3 line appears exactly once.
The Error Tags: [a,b,c] line appears exactly once, where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis because of line thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels and faint guidelines/erasures; those are not the curve.
  • A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
  • DEDUCT only when a continuous part of the drawn curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
  • AWARD only if at least ONE of the following appears:
    – the coordinate text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, or
    – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, or
    – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby “1” label.
  • DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis, a “1” written near the axis without a dot,
    a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis, “(0;1)”, “(½;−1)”, “2”, ticks, or generic marks.
  • Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.

Check C — Log shape (base >1)
  • AWARD if the main curve is overall increasing and concave down (steep near x→0⁺, flatter to the right).
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if the ends bend and it is monotone increasing, AWARD (S17/S1-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

PREREQUISITES (axes handling)
  • If EITHER axis is missing or not drawn (no visible coordinate axes), set A=0 and B=0.
    Shape (C) may still be awarded if the curve alone clearly looks like a log; otherwise C=0.
    (Max possible without axes is 1/3.)

MULTIPLE CURVES
  • Only grade the intended inverse log curve. If several curves appear, use the one labeled “h⁻¹”;
    otherwise choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in the first quadrant neighborhood.
  • Do not use markings/labels from other curves (“h”, exponential distractors) to award any check.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
  • Never infer B from shape/crossing alone. Missing the explicit tokens above → B=0.
  • 1/3 should be rare: use it when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds (common case: axes absent → only C may hold).

WHAT TO IGNORE
  • Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, arrowheads, axis ticks, and faint guidelines.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (required before deciding)
• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.
  – Curve count on the axes: <number>; h⁻¹ label present? <yes/no>.
  – Left-of-y evidence: “none / tiny nib / continuous segment length≈<…>”.
  – X-intercept tokens (quote verbatim in order): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
  – Accepted for B (and why attached to h⁻¹): <list/none>.
  – Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
• If you cannot quote an acceptable token for B, set B=0. If you cannot rule out left-of-axis contact except for smudge/thickness, AWARD A.

CONSISTENCY CHECK (must pass)
• ErrorTags must be [shape(C), x_intercept(B), asymptote(A)] as 0/1.
• Mark must equal the sum of ErrorTags (0–3). If not, adjust the mark to match the tags.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from crossing alone. Without an acceptable token, B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For EACH student 1..26, output exactly this block — no extra prose, no extra blank lines, and do not restate other students. The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
• S6-type (hyperbolic/overlaps y-axis, multi-curve): lower “h⁻¹” runs along/crosses the y-axis; labels belong to other curves → A=0, B=0, C=0 ⇒ 0/3.
• Lower straight-ish segment: monotone but almost linear, no concave-down log shape → C=0. If axes present and no B evidence → 0/3 (or 1/3 only if A=1).
• No axes: Axes absent → 0/3.
• Writes “(0;1)” (not “(1;0)”): B=0 unless explicit “(1;0)”/“x=1”/labeled dot at x≈1 is also present for h⁻¹.
• Borderline but bends at ends and is increasing (S17/S1): C=1 provided the steep-to-flat pattern is visible and curve stays in x>0.
• “(1;0)” text present (even without a dot) and clearly attached to h⁻¹ → B=1.
• Curve crosses near x≈1 but NO label/coordinate → B=0.
• Axes missing → A=0, B=0; C may be 0 or 1 depending on shape (thus only 0/3 or 1/3 possible).

You are grading hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2). Use the attached memorandum drawing as ground truth. Grade each student independently. Follow the rubric exactly. Output must follow the schema below with no extra prose or headers.

RUBRIC (apply in this order; each awarded = 1 mark; total out of 3)
A. ASYMPTOTE (y-axis at x=0)
   • Award if the drawn curve does NOT clearly cross the y-axis.
   • Touching or brushing the axis counts as NOT crossing.
   • Axis ticks, labels, or arrowheads are NOT the curve.
   • Deduct only when a visible part of the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.

B. X-INTERCEPT at (1;0)
   • Award if any of the following are present near x≈1 on the x-axis:
     (i) a dot with a nearby “1” label,
     (ii) the coordinate (1;0) or (1,0),
     (iii) “x=1”.
   • x-intercept tolerance: treat markings from x=0.8 to x=1.2 as at x=1.
   • Do NOT infer the intercept from curve shape alone if there is no dot/label/crossing.

C. SHAPE of a log curve with base >1
   • Award if the main curve is increasing and concave down, with a steep left tail as x→0⁺ and a slowly rising right tail.
   • The curve may be rough; if it shows some curvature at the ends and is overall increasing, award (borderline S17-type drawings qualify).
   • Deduct if the drawing is obviously an exponential (concave up), a straight line with no curvature, or decreasing.

AMBIGUITY POLICY
• For A and B: if ambiguous, AWARD.
• For C: award when there is some curvature and monotone increase; otherwise deduct.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, shading, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and stray pencil marks.
• If multiple curves appear, choose the one nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.

STRICT vs RELAXED
• STRICT mark (“Mark”) is the sum of A/B/C decisions above (0–3). ErrorTags must match these decisions exactly.
• RELAXED potential marks (“PotentialMarks”) list all marks that could reasonably be awarded under generous interpretation:
  – award A and/or B if borderline,
  – award C if there is some curvature and monotone increase.
• PotentialMarks must be a sorted list of unique integers from {0,1,2,3} and MUST include the strict mark.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — do not deviate)
For EACH student, output exactly the following block. Use plain text, no markdown. Do not add blank lines between fields other than those shown. Do not echo examples. Do not write “3/3” anywhere except the single Mark line. Do not restate earlier students’ marks.

Reasons:
• Shape: <one concise sentence stating why awarded/deducted>
• x-intercept: <one concise sentence>
• Asymptote: <one concise sentence>
PotentialMarks: [<comma-separated integers from {0,1,2,3}>]

NOTES FOR REASONS
• Keep each reason to one sentence, factual and tied to the rubric.
• Use only numerals and standard coordinate forms (e.g., (1;0) or (1,0)) inside the Reasons.
• Never include any additional “/3” strings anywhere in Reasons or PotentialMarks.

IN-CONTEXT EXAMPLES (for understanding only — DO NOT OUTPUT THESE; they use “of” to avoid the “/3” token)
Example A (perfect memo-like)
Student EX-A
Mark: `3 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]
Reasons:
• Shape: Increasing, concave-down log curve matching the memo.
• x-intercept: Dot and label at x=1 on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
PotentialMarks: [3]

Example B (borderline S17-like)
Student EX-B
Mark: `2 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  (or [1,1,1] if it only touches)
Reasons:
• Shape: Mostly straight but bends at ends and is overall increasing, so award shape.
• x-intercept: “1” marked on the x-axis near the crossing at x≈1.
• Asymptote: [state “crosses” if any part lies left of the y-axis; otherwise “does not cross”].
PotentialMarks: [1,2,3]

Example C (exponential S6-like)
Student EX-C
Mark: `0 of 3`
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]
Reasons:
• Shape: Exponential (concave up) rather than logarithmic.
• x-intercept: No valid (1;0) indication on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Drawing not consistent with a log graph’s y-axis asymptote.
PotentialMarks: [0,1]

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For each student 1..26 output exactly the block below — no extra prose, no blank lines.
The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
(two full curves on the same axes; h⁻¹ hugs/runs along y-axis): evidence belongs to other curve(s); h⁻¹ shows hyperbolic behavior and y-axis contact → Shape=0, X=0, Asymptote=0 ⇒ Final 0/3.

(good memo-like): clear concave-down increase; “(1;0)” marked for h⁻¹; no continuous left-of-axis stroke → 3/3.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

(hyperbolic/overlaps y-axis): lower “h⁻¹” runs along/crosses the y-axis and is not concave down → A=0, C=0, B=0 ⇒ 0/3.
(lower straight-ish segment): monotone but almost linear, no concave-down log shape → C=0. If axes present and no B evidence → 0/3 (or 1/3 only if A=1 and C=0 fails).
(no axes): Axes absent → 0/3.
(writes “(0;1)”, not “(1;0)”): B=0 unless explicit “(1;0)”/“x=1”/labeled dot at x≈1 is also present.
(borderline but bends at ends and is increasing): C=1 provided the steep-to-flat pattern is visible.
“(1;0)” text present (even without a dot) → B=1.

Your goal is to grade hand-drawn graphs accurately and consistently based on the provided memorandum and student work. Adhere to the following principles:
Precision over Guesswork: Follow the provided rubric strictly. Do not infer student intent unless the rubric explicitly allows it.
Benefit of the Doubt (BoD): These are hand-drawn sketches. For ambiguous cases (e.g., a shaky line, a curve that isn't perfectly smooth), err on the side of awarding the mark unless a clear conceptual error is visible.
Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for correctness and leniency.
Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Final Review and System Instruction
After analyzing all students, review your entire response. Before concluding, ensure that for EACH student:
The Final Mark: X/3 line appears exactly once.
The Error Tags: [a,b,c] line appears exactly once, where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1.

You are grading hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2). Use the attached memorandum drawing as ground truth. Grade each student independently. Follow the rubric exactly. Output must follow the schema below with no extra prose or headers.

RUBRIC (apply in this order; each awarded = 1 mark; total out of 3)
A. ASYMPTOTE (y-axis at x=0)
   • Award if the drawn curve does NOT clearly cross the y-axis.
   • Touching or brushing the axis counts as NOT crossing.
   • Axis ticks, labels, or arrowheads are NOT the curve.
   • Deduct only when a visible part of the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.

B. X-INTERCEPT at (1;0)
   • Award if any of the following are present near x≈1 on the x-axis:
     (i) a dot with a nearby “1” label,
     (ii) the coordinate (1;0) or (1,0),
     (iii) “x=1”.
   • x-intercept tolerance: treat markings from x=0.8 to x=1.2 as at x=1.
   • Do NOT infer the intercept from curve shape alone if there is no dot/label/crossing.

C. SHAPE of a log curve with base >1
   • Award if the main curve is increasing and concave down, with a steep left tail as x→0⁺ and a slowly rising right tail.
   • The curve may be rough; if it shows some curvature at the ends and is overall increasing, award (borderline S17-type drawings qualify).
   • Deduct if the drawing is obviously an exponential (concave up), a straight line with no curvature, or decreasing.

AMBIGUITY POLICY
• For A and B: if ambiguous, AWARD.
• For C: award when there is some curvature and monotone increase; otherwise deduct.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, shading, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and stray pencil marks.
• If multiple curves appear, choose the one nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.

STRICT vs RELAXED
• STRICT mark (“Mark”) is the sum of A/B/C decisions above (0–3). ErrorTags must match these decisions exactly.
• RELAXED potential marks (“PotentialMarks”) list all marks that could reasonably be awarded under generous interpretation:
  – award A and/or B if borderline,
  – award C if there is some curvature and monotone increase.
• PotentialMarks must be a sorted list of unique integers from {0,1,2,3} and MUST include the strict mark.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — do not deviate)
For EACH student, output exactly the following block. Use plain text, no markdown. Do not add blank lines between fields other than those shown. Do not echo examples. Do not write “3/3” anywhere except the single Mark line. Do not restate earlier students’ marks.

• x-intercept: <one concise sentence>
• Asymptote: <one concise sentence>
PotentialMarks: [<comma-separated integers from {0,1,2,3}>]

NOTES FOR REASONS
• Keep each reason to one sentence, factual and tied to the rubric.
• Use only numerals and standard coordinate forms (e.g., (1;0) or (1,0)) inside the Reasons.
• Never include any additional “/3” strings anywhere in Reasons or PotentialMarks.

IN-CONTEXT EXAMPLES (for understanding only — DO NOT OUTPUT THESE; they use “of” to avoid the “/3” token)
Example A (perfect memo-like)
Student EX-A
Mark: `3 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]
Reasons:
• Shape: Increasing, concave-down log curve matching the memo.
• x-intercept: Dot and label at x=1 on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
PotentialMarks: [3]

Example B (borderline S17-like)
Student EX-B
Mark: `2 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  (or [1,1,1] if it only touches)
Reasons:
• Shape: Mostly straight but bends at ends and is overall increasing, so award shape.
• x-intercept: “1” marked on the x-axis near the crossing at x≈1.
• Asymptote: [state “crosses” if any part lies left of the y-axis; otherwise “does not cross”].
PotentialMarks: [1,2,3]

Example C (exponential S6-like)
Student EX-C
Mark: `0 of 3`
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]
Reasons:
• Shape: Exponential (concave up) rather than logarithmic.
• x-intercept: No valid (1;0) indication on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Drawing not consistent with a log graph’s y-axis asymptote.
PotentialMarks: [0,1]

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (required before deciding)
• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.
  – Curve count on the axes: <number>; h⁻¹ label present? <yes/no>.
  – Left-of-y evidence: “none / tiny nib / continuous segment length≈<…>”.
  – X-intercept tokens (quote verbatim in order): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
  – Accepted for B (and why attached to h⁻¹): <list/none>.
  – Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
• If you cannot quote an acceptable token for B, set B=0. If you cannot rule out left-of-axis contact except for smudge/thickness, AWARD A.

CONSISTENCY CHECK (must pass)
• ErrorTags must be [shape(C), x_intercept(B), asymptote(A)] as 0/1.
• Mark must equal the sum of ErrorTags (0–3). If not, adjust the mark to match the tags.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from crossing alone. Without an acceptable token, B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For EACH student 1..26, output exactly this block — no extra prose, no extra blank lines, and do not restate other students. The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
• S6-type (hyperbolic/overlaps y-axis, multi-curve): lower “h⁻¹” runs along/crosses the y-axis; labels belong to other curves → A=0, B=0, C=0 ⇒ 0/3.
• Lower straight-ish segment: monotone but almost linear, no concave-down log shape → C=0. If axes present and no B evidence → 0/3 (or 1/3 only if A=1).
• No axes: Axes absent → 0/3.
• Writes “(0;1)” (not “(1;0)”): B=0 unless explicit “(1;0)”/“x=1”/labeled dot at x≈1 is also present for h⁻¹.
• Borderline but bends at ends and is increasing (S17/S1): C=1 provided the steep-to-flat pattern is visible and curve stays in x>0.
• “(1;0)” text present (even without a dot) and clearly attached to h⁻¹ → B=1.
• Curve crosses near x≈1 but NO label/coordinate → B=0.
• Axes missing → A=0, B=0; C may be 0 or 1 depending on shape (thus only 0/3 or 1/3 possible).
• S11/S3-style near-touch at y-axis: no continuous left-of-axis segment → A=1.
• S19-style multiple curves with no B token for h⁻¹: B=0 (overall ≤2/3).",APE,GPT-4.1,Group1,0.5,,

Your goal is to grade hand-drawn graphs accurately and consistently based on the provided memorandum and student work. Adhere to the following principles:
Precision over Guesswork: Follow the provided rubric strictly. Do not infer student intent unless the rubric explicitly allows it.
Benefit of the Doubt (BoD): These are hand-drawn sketches. For ambiguous cases (e.g., a shaky line, a curve that isn't perfectly smooth), err on the side of awarding the mark unless a clear conceptual error is visible.
Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for correctness and leniency.
Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Final Review and System Instruction
After analyzing all students, review your entire response. Before concluding, ensure that for EACH student:
The Final Mark: X/3 line appears exactly once.
The Error Tags: [a,b,c] line appears exactly once, where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1.
The reasoning provided for each mark directly corresponds to the rubric.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For each student 1..26 output exactly the block below — no extra prose, no blank lines.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
(two full curves on the same axes; h⁻¹ hugs/runs along y-axis): evidence belongs to other curve(s); h⁻¹ shows hyperbolic behavior and y-axis contact → Shape=0, X=0, Asymptote=0 ⇒ Final 0/3.

You are grading hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2). Use the attached memorandum drawing as ground truth. Grade each student independently. Follow the rubric exactly. Output must follow the schema below with no extra prose or headers.

RUBRIC (apply in this order; each awarded = 1 mark; total out of 3)
A. ASYMPTOTE (y-axis at x=0)
   • Award if the drawn curve does NOT clearly cross the y-axis.
   • Touching or brushing the axis counts as NOT crossing.
   • Axis ticks, labels, or arrowheads are NOT the curve.
   • Deduct only when a visible part of the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.

B. X-INTERCEPT at (1;0)
   • Award if any of the following are present near x≈1 on the x-axis:
     (i) a dot with a nearby “1” label,
     (ii) the coordinate (1;0) or (1,0),
     (iii) “x=1”.
   • x-intercept tolerance: treat markings from x=0.8 to x=1.2 as at x=1.
   • Do NOT infer the intercept from curve shape alone if there is no dot/label/crossing.

C. SHAPE of a log curve with base >1
   • Award if the main curve is increasing and concave down, with a steep left tail as x→0⁺ and a slowly rising right tail.
   • The curve may be rough; if it shows some curvature at the ends and is overall increasing, award (borderline S17-type drawings qualify).
   • Deduct if the drawing is obviously an exponential (concave up), a straight line with no curvature, or decreasing.

AMBIGUITY POLICY
• For A and B: if ambiguous, AWARD.
• For C: award when there is some curvature and monotone increase; otherwise deduct.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, shading, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and stray pencil marks.
• If multiple curves appear, choose the one nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.

STRICT vs RELAXED
• STRICT mark (“Mark”) is the sum of A/B/C decisions above (0–3). ErrorTags must match these decisions exactly.
• RELAXED potential marks (“PotentialMarks”) list all marks that could reasonably be awarded under generous interpretation:
  – award A and/or B if borderline,
  – award C if there is some curvature and monotone increase.
• PotentialMarks must be a sorted list of unique integers from {0,1,2,3} and MUST include the strict mark.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — do not deviate)
For EACH student, output exactly the following block. Use plain text, no markdown. Do not add blank lines between fields other than those shown. Do not echo examples. Do not write “3/3” anywhere except the single Mark line. Do not restate earlier students’ marks.

Reasons:
• Shape: <one concise sentence stating why awarded/deducted>
• x-intercept: <one concise sentence>
• Asymptote: <one concise sentence>
PotentialMarks: [<comma-separated integers from {0,1,2,3}>]

NOTES FOR REASONS
• Keep each reason to one sentence, factual and tied to the rubric.
• Use only numerals and standard coordinate forms (e.g., (1;0) or (1,0)) inside the Reasons.
• Never include any additional “/3” strings anywhere in Reasons or PotentialMarks.

IN-CONTEXT EXAMPLES (for understanding only — DO NOT OUTPUT THESE; they use “of” to avoid the “/3” token)
Example A (perfect memo-like)
Student EX-A
Mark: `3 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]
Reasons:
• Shape: Increasing, concave-down log curve matching the memo.
• x-intercept: Dot and label at x=1 on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
PotentialMarks: [3]

Example B (borderline S17-like)
Student EX-B
Mark: `2 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  (or [1,1,1] if it only touches)
Reasons:
• Shape: Mostly straight but bends at ends and is overall increasing, so award shape.
• x-intercept: “1” marked on the x-axis near the crossing at x≈1.
• Asymptote: [state “crosses” if any part lies left of the y-axis; otherwise “does not cross”].
PotentialMarks: [1,2,3]

Example C (exponential S6-like)
Student EX-C
Mark: `0 of 3`
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]
Reasons:
• Shape: Exponential (concave up) rather than logarithmic.
• x-intercept: No valid (1;0) indication on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Drawing not consistent with a log graph’s y-axis asymptote.
PotentialMarks: [0,1]

    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis because of line thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels and faint guidelines/erasures; those are not the curve.
  • A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
  • DEDUCT only when a continuous part of the drawn curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
  • AWARD only if at least ONE of the following appears:
    – the coordinate text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, or
    – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, or
    – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby “1” label.
  • DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis, a “1” written near the axis without a dot,
    a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis, “(0;1)”, “(½;−1)”, “2”, ticks, or generic marks.
  • Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.

Check C — Log shape (base >1)
  • AWARD if the main curve is overall increasing and concave down (steep near x→0⁺, flatter to the right).
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if the ends bend and it is monotone increasing, AWARD (S17/S1-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

PREREQUISITES (axes handling)
  • If EITHER axis is missing or not drawn (no visible coordinate axes), set A=0 and B=0.
    Shape (C) may still be awarded if the curve alone clearly looks like a log; otherwise C=0.
    (Max possible without axes is 1/3.)

MULTIPLE CURVES
  • Only grade the intended inverse log curve. If several curves appear, use the one labeled “h⁻¹”;
    otherwise choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in the first quadrant neighborhood.
  • Do not use markings/labels from other curves (“h”, exponential distractors) to award any check.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
  • Never infer B from shape/crossing alone. Missing the explicit tokens above → B=0.
  • 1/3 should be rare: use it when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds (common case: axes absent → only C may hold).

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (required before deciding)
• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.
  – Curve count on the axes: <number>; h⁻¹ label present? <yes/no>.
  – Left-of-y evidence: “none / tiny nib / continuous segment length≈<…>”.
  – X-intercept tokens (quote verbatim in order): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
  – Accepted for B (and why attached to h⁻¹): <list/none>.
  – Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
• If you cannot quote an acceptable token for B, set B=0. If you cannot rule out left-of-axis contact except for smudge/thickness, AWARD A.

CONSISTENCY CHECK (must pass)
• ErrorTags must be [shape(C), x_intercept(B), asymptote(A)] as 0/1.
• Mark must equal the sum of ErrorTags (0–3). If not, adjust the mark to match the tags.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from crossing alone. Without an acceptable token, B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

Your goal is to grade hand-drawn graphs accurately and consistently based on the provided memorandum and student work. Adhere to the following principles:
Precision over Guesswork: Follow the provided rubric strictly. Do not infer student intent unless the rubric explicitly allows it.
Benefit of the Doubt (BoD): These are hand-drawn sketches. For ambiguous cases (e.g., a shaky line, a curve that isn't perfectly smooth), err on the side of awarding the mark unless a clear conceptual error is visible.
Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for correctness and leniency.
Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Final Review and System Instruction
After analyzing all students, review your entire response. Before concluding, ensure that for EACH student:
The Final Mark: X/3 line appears exactly once.
The Error Tags: [a,b,c] line appears exactly once, where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:

The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For each student 1..26 output exactly the block below — no extra prose, no blank lines.
The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

You are grading hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2). Use the attached memorandum drawing as ground truth. Grade each student independently. Follow the rubric exactly. Output must follow the schema below with no extra prose or headers.

RUBRIC (apply in this order; each awarded = 1 mark; total out of 3)
A. ASYMPTOTE (y-axis at x=0)
   • Award if the drawn curve does NOT clearly cross the y-axis.
   • Touching or brushing the axis counts as NOT crossing.
   • Axis ticks, labels, or arrowheads are NOT the curve.
   • Deduct only when a visible part of the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.

B. X-INTERCEPT at (1;0)
   • Award if any of the following are present near x≈1 on the x-axis:
     (i) a dot with a nearby “1” label,
     (ii) the coordinate (1;0) or (1,0),
     (iii) “x=1”.
   • x-intercept tolerance: treat markings from x=0.8 to x=1.2 as at x=1.
   • Do NOT infer the intercept from curve shape alone if there is no dot/label/crossing.

C. SHAPE of a log curve with base >1
   • Award if the main curve is increasing and concave down, with a steep left tail as x→0⁺ and a slowly rising right tail.
   • The curve may be rough; if it shows some curvature at the ends and is overall increasing, award (borderline S17-type drawings qualify).
   • Deduct if the drawing is obviously an exponential (concave up), a straight line with no curvature, or decreasing.

AMBIGUITY POLICY
• For A and B: if ambiguous, AWARD.
• For C: award when there is some curvature and monotone increase; otherwise deduct.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, shading, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and stray pencil marks.
• If multiple curves appear, choose the one nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.

STRICT vs RELAXED
• STRICT mark (“Mark”) is the sum of A/B/C decisions above (0–3). ErrorTags must match these decisions exactly.
• RELAXED potential marks (“PotentialMarks”) list all marks that could reasonably be awarded under generous interpretation:
  – award A and/or B if borderline,
  – award C if there is some curvature and monotone increase.
• PotentialMarks must be a sorted list of unique integers from {0,1,2,3} and MUST include the strict mark.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — do not deviate)
For EACH student, output exactly the following block. Use plain text, no markdown. Do not add blank lines between fields other than those shown. Do not echo examples. Do not write “3/3” anywhere except the single Mark line. Do not restate earlier students’ marks.

Student <number>
Mark: `<X>/3`     <-- appears exactly once for this student
ErrorTags: [shape,x_intercept,asymptote] as [0/1,0/1,0/1]
Reasons:
• Shape: <one concise sentence stating why awarded/deducted>
• x-intercept: <one concise sentence>
• Asymptote: <one concise sentence>
PotentialMarks: [<comma-separated integers from {0,1,2,3}>]

NOTES FOR REASONS
• Keep each reason to one sentence, factual and tied to the rubric.
• Use only numerals and standard coordinate forms (e.g., (1;0) or (1,0)) inside the Reasons.
• Never include any additional “/3” strings anywhere in Reasons or PotentialMarks.

IN-CONTEXT EXAMPLES (for understanding only — DO NOT OUTPUT THESE; they use “of” to avoid the “/3” token)
Example A (perfect memo-like)
Student EX-A
Mark: `3 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]
Reasons:
• Shape: Increasing, concave-down log curve matching the memo.
• x-intercept: Dot and label at x=1 on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
PotentialMarks: [3]

Example B (borderline S17-like)
Student EX-B
Mark: `2 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  (or [1,1,1] if it only touches)
Reasons:
• Shape: Mostly straight but bends at ends and is overall increasing, so award shape.
• x-intercept: “1” marked on the x-axis near the crossing at x≈1.
• Asymptote: [state “crosses” if any part lies left of the y-axis; otherwise “does not cross”].
PotentialMarks: [1,2,3]

Example C (exponential S6-like)
Student EX-C
Mark: `0 of 3`
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]
Reasons:
• Shape: Exponential (concave up) rather than logarithmic.
• x-intercept: No valid (1;0) indication on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Drawing not consistent with a log graph’s y-axis asymptote.
PotentialMarks: [0,1]

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis because of line thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels and faint guidelines/erasures; those are not the curve.
  • A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
  • DEDUCT only when a continuous part of the drawn curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
  • AWARD only if at least ONE of the following appears:
    – the coordinate text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, or
    – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, or
    – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby “1” label.
  • DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis, a “1” written near the axis without a dot,
    a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis, “(0;1)”, “(½;−1)”, “2”, ticks, or generic marks.
  • Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.

Check C — Log shape (base >1)

  • Hand sketches may be rough; if the ends bend and it is monotone increasing, AWARD (S17/S1-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

PREREQUISITES (axes handling)
  • If EITHER axis is missing or not drawn (no visible coordinate axes), set A=0 and B=0.
    Shape (C) may still be awarded if the curve alone clearly looks like a log; otherwise C=0.
    (Max possible without axes is 1/3.)

MULTIPLE CURVES
  • Only grade the intended inverse log curve. If several curves appear, use the one labeled “h⁻¹”;
    otherwise choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in the first quadrant neighborhood.
  • Do not use markings/labels from other curves (“h”, exponential distractors) to award any check.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
  • Never infer B from shape/crossing alone. Missing the explicit tokens above → B=0.
  • 1/3 should be rare: use it when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds (common case: axes absent → only C may hold).

WHAT TO IGNORE
  • Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, arrowheads, axis ticks, and faint guidelines.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (required before deciding)
• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.
  – Curve count on the axes: <number>; h⁻¹ label present? <yes/no>.
  – Left-of-y evidence: “none / tiny nib / continuous segment length≈<…>”.
  – X-intercept tokens (quote verbatim in order): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
  – Accepted for B (and why attached to h⁻¹): <list/none>.
  – Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
• If you cannot quote an acceptable token for B, set B=0. If you cannot rule out left-of-axis contact except for smudge/thickness, AWARD A.

CONSISTENCY CHECK (must pass)
• ErrorTags must be [shape(C), x_intercept(B), asymptote(A)] as 0/1.
• Mark must equal the sum of ErrorTags (0–3). If not, adjust the mark to match the tags.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from crossing alone. Without an acceptable token, B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

Your goal is to grade hand-drawn graphs accurately and consistently based on the provided memorandum and student work. Adhere to the following principles:
Precision over Guesswork: Follow the provided rubric strictly. Do not infer student intent unless the rubric explicitly allows it.
Benefit of the Doubt (BoD): These are hand-drawn sketches. For ambiguous cases (e.g., a shaky line, a curve that isn't perfectly smooth), err on the side of awarding the mark unless a clear conceptual error is visible.
Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for correctness and leniency.
Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Final Review and System Instruction
After analyzing all students, review your entire response. Before concluding, ensure that for EACH student:
The Final Mark: X/3 line appears exactly once.
The Error Tags: [a,b,c] line appears exactly once, where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

You are grading hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2). Use the attached memorandum drawing as ground truth. Grade each student independently. Follow the rubric exactly. Output must follow the schema below with no extra prose or headers.

RUBRIC (apply in this order; each awarded = 1 mark; total out of 3)
A. ASYMPTOTE (y-axis at x=0)
   • Award if the drawn curve does NOT clearly cross the y-axis.
   • Touching or brushing the axis counts as NOT crossing.
   • Axis ticks, labels, or arrowheads are NOT the curve.
   • Deduct only when a visible part of the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.

B. X-INTERCEPT at (1;0)
   • Award if any of the following are present near x≈1 on the x-axis:
     (i) a dot with a nearby “1” label,
     (ii) the coordinate (1;0) or (1,0),
     (iii) “x=1”.
   • x-intercept tolerance: treat markings from x=0.8 to x=1.2 as at x=1.
   • Do NOT infer the intercept from curve shape alone if there is no dot/label/crossing.

C. SHAPE of a log curve with base >1
   • Award if the main curve is increasing and concave down, with a steep left tail as x→0⁺ and a slowly rising right tail.
   • The curve may be rough; if it shows some curvature at the ends and is overall increasing, award (borderline S17-type drawings qualify).
   • Deduct if the drawing is obviously an exponential (concave up), a straight line with no curvature, or decreasing.

AMBIGUITY POLICY
• For A and B: if ambiguous, AWARD.
• For C: award when there is some curvature and monotone increase; otherwise deduct.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, shading, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and stray pencil marks.
• If multiple curves appear, choose the one nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.

STRICT vs RELAXED
• STRICT mark (“Mark”) is the sum of A/B/C decisions above (0–3). ErrorTags must match these decisions exactly.
• RELAXED potential marks (“PotentialMarks”) list all marks that could reasonably be awarded under generous interpretation:
  – award A and/or B if borderline,
  – award C if there is some curvature and monotone increase.
• PotentialMarks must be a sorted list of unique integers from {0,1,2,3} and MUST include the strict mark.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — do not deviate)
For EACH student, output exactly the following block. Use plain text, no markdown. Do not add blank lines between fields other than those shown. Do not echo examples. Do not write “3/3” anywhere except the single Mark line. Do not restate earlier students’ marks.

Student <number>
Mark: `<X>/3`     <-- appears exactly once for this student
ErrorTags: [shape,x_intercept,asymptote] as [0/1,0/1,0/1]
Reasons:
• Shape: <one concise sentence stating why awarded/deducted>
• x-intercept: <one concise sentence>
• Asymptote: <one concise sentence>
PotentialMarks: [<comma-separated integers from {0,1,2,3}>]

NOTES FOR REASONS
• Keep each reason to one sentence, factual and tied to the rubric.
• Use only numerals and standard coordinate forms (e.g., (1;0) or (1,0)) inside the Reasons.
• Never include any additional “/3” strings anywhere in Reasons or PotentialMarks.

IN-CONTEXT EXAMPLES (for understanding only — DO NOT OUTPUT THESE; they use “of” to avoid the “/3” token)
Example A (perfect memo-like)
Student EX-A
Mark: `3 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]
Reasons:
• Shape: Increasing, concave-down log curve matching the memo.
• x-intercept: Dot and label at x=1 on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
PotentialMarks: [3]

Example B (borderline S17-like)
Student EX-B
Mark: `2 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  (or [1,1,1] if it only touches)
Reasons:
• Shape: Mostly straight but bends at ends and is overall increasing, so award shape.
• x-intercept: “1” marked on the x-axis near the crossing at x≈1.
• Asymptote: [state “crosses” if any part lies left of the y-axis; otherwise “does not cross”].
PotentialMarks: [1,2,3]

Example C (exponential S6-like)
Student EX-C
Mark: `0 of 3`
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]
Reasons:
• Shape: Exponential (concave up) rather than logarithmic.
• x-intercept: No valid (1;0) indication on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Drawing not consistent with a log graph’s y-axis asymptote.
PotentialMarks: [0,1]

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

    – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, or
    – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby “1” label.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (required before deciding)
• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.
  – Curve count on the axes: <number>; h⁻¹ label present? <yes/no>.
  – Left-of-y evidence: “none / tiny nib / continuous segment length≈<…>”.
  – X-intercept tokens (quote verbatim in order): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
  – Accepted for B (and why attached to h⁻¹): <list/none>.
  – Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
• If you cannot quote an acceptable token for B, set B=0. If you cannot rule out left-of-axis contact except for smudge/thickness, AWARD A.

CONSISTENCY CHECK (must pass)
• ErrorTags must be [shape(C), x_intercept(B), asymptote(A)] as 0/1.
• Mark must equal the sum of ErrorTags (0–3). If not, adjust the mark to match the tags.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from crossing alone. Without an acceptable token, B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

Your goal is to grade hand-drawn graphs accurately and consistently based on the provided memorandum and student work. Adhere to the following principles:
Precision over Guesswork: Follow the provided rubric strictly. Do not infer student intent unless the rubric explicitly allows it.
Benefit of the Doubt (BoD): These are hand-drawn sketches. For ambiguous cases (e.g., a shaky line, a curve that isn't perfectly smooth), err on the side of awarding the mark unless a clear conceptual error is visible.
Consistency is Key: Apply the same level of scrutiny to every graph. Use the provided exemplars as your baseline for correctness and leniency.
Foundational Requirements
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Final Review and System Instruction
After analyzing all students, review your entire response. Before concluding, ensure that for EACH student:
The Final Mark: X/3 line appears exactly once.
The Error Tags: [a,b,c] line appears exactly once, where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1.
The reasoning provided for each mark directly corresponds to the rubric.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For each student 1..26 output exactly the block below — no extra prose, no blank lines.
The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): <list>; Accepted for X: <list/none>.
• Curvature summary: <one clause>.
Reasons:
• Shape: <why 1 or 0 per curvature cues>.
• x-intercept: <why 1 or 0 based on accepted tokens attached to h⁻¹>.
• Asymptote: <why 1 or 0; mention continuous left-of-axis or its absence>.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
(two full curves on the same axes; h⁻¹ hugs/runs along y-axis): evidence belongs to other curve(s); h⁻¹ shows hyperbolic behavior and y-axis contact → Shape=0, X=0, Asymptote=0 ⇒ Final 0/3.
(mostly straight, then kicks up; contact at origin or left-of-y): Shape=0 (straight/piecewise & concave-up end); X=0 (no valid token); Asymptote=0 (clear point contact at y-axis/left segment) ⇒ 0/3.
(good memo-like): clear concave-down increase; “(1;0)” marked for h⁻¹; no continuous left-of-axis stroke → 3/3.
(multi-curve; no X token for h⁻¹): even if Shape and Asymptote look okay, X=0 (no acceptable token attached to h⁻¹) ⇒ at most 2/3.
No axes (S24-type): Rule 0 triggers → 0/3.

You are grading hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2). Use the attached memorandum drawing as ground truth. Grade each student independently. Follow the rubric exactly. Output must follow the schema below with no extra prose or headers.

RUBRIC (apply in this order; each awarded = 1 mark; total out of 3)
A. ASYMPTOTE (y-axis at x=0)
   • Award if the drawn curve does NOT clearly cross the y-axis.
   • Touching or brushing the axis counts as NOT crossing.
   • Axis ticks, labels, or arrowheads are NOT the curve.
   • Deduct only when a visible part of the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.

B. X-INTERCEPT at (1;0)
   • Award if any of the following are present near x≈1 on the x-axis:
     (i) a dot with a nearby “1” label,
     (ii) the coordinate (1;0) or (1,0),
     (iii) “x=1”.
   • x-intercept tolerance: treat markings from x=0.8 to x=1.2 as at x=1.
   • Do NOT infer the intercept from curve shape alone if there is no dot/label/crossing.

C. SHAPE of a log curve with base >1
   • Award if the main curve is increasing and concave down, with a steep left tail as x→0⁺ and a slowly rising right tail.
   • The curve may be rough; if it shows some curvature at the ends and is overall increasing, award (borderline S17-type drawings qualify).
   • Deduct if the drawing is obviously an exponential (concave up), a straight line with no curvature, or decreasing.

AMBIGUITY POLICY
• For A and B: if ambiguous, AWARD.
• For C: award when there is some curvature and monotone increase; otherwise deduct.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, shading, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and stray pencil marks.
• If multiple curves appear, choose the one nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.

STRICT vs RELAXED
• STRICT mark (“Mark”) is the sum of A/B/C decisions above (0–3). ErrorTags must match these decisions exactly.
• RELAXED potential marks (“PotentialMarks”) list all marks that could reasonably be awarded under generous interpretation:
  – award A and/or B if borderline,
  – award C if there is some curvature and monotone increase.
• PotentialMarks must be a sorted list of unique integers from {0,1,2,3} and MUST include the strict mark.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — do not deviate)
For EACH student, output exactly the following block. Use plain text, no markdown. Do not add blank lines between fields other than those shown. Do not echo examples. Do not write “3/3” anywhere except the single Mark line. Do not restate earlier students’ marks.

Reasons:
• Shape: <one concise sentence stating why awarded/deducted>
• x-intercept: <one concise sentence>
• Asymptote: <one concise sentence>
PotentialMarks: [<comma-separated integers from {0,1,2,3}>]

NOTES FOR REASONS
• Keep each reason to one sentence, factual and tied to the rubric.
• Use only numerals and standard coordinate forms (e.g., (1;0) or (1,0)) inside the Reasons.
• Never include any additional “/3” strings anywhere in Reasons or PotentialMarks.

IN-CONTEXT EXAMPLES (for understanding only — DO NOT OUTPUT THESE; they use “of” to avoid the “/3” token)
Example A (perfect memo-like)
Student EX-A
Mark: `3 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]
Reasons:
• Shape: Increasing, concave-down log curve matching the memo.
• x-intercept: Dot and label at x=1 on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.
PotentialMarks: [3]

Example B (borderline S17-like)
Student EX-B
Mark: `2 of 3`
ErrorTags: [1,1,0]  (or [1,1,1] if it only touches)
Reasons:
• Shape: Mostly straight but bends at ends and is overall increasing, so award shape.
• x-intercept: “1” marked on the x-axis near the crossing at x≈1.
• Asymptote: [state “crosses” if any part lies left of the y-axis; otherwise “does not cross”].
PotentialMarks: [1,2,3]

Example C (exponential S6-like)
Student EX-C
Mark: `0 of 3`
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]
Reasons:
• Shape: Exponential (concave up) rather than logarithmic.
• x-intercept: No valid (1;0) indication on the x-axis.
• Asymptote: Drawing not consistent with a log graph’s y-axis asymptote.
PotentialMarks: [0,1]

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULE ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent or the curve is drawn without axes, assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do not infer anything from the curve alone.
• If axes exist but are clearly unrelated to the graded curve (e.g., drawn elsewhere), treat as “axes absent”.

CURVE SELECTION
• Grade ONLY the inverse log curve. If multiple curves appear, prefer the one labeled “h⁻¹”. If none is labeled, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies near the first quadrant. Do NOT use marks/labels from a different curve (e.g., “h”) to award any criterion.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays strictly in x>0.
• Small nibs from pen thickness that just touch are OK. 
• DEDUCT if a continuous piece of the drawn curve lies on or left of the y-axis, OR the curve runs along the y-axis for a visible segment, OR it clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [EVIDENCE REQUIRED]
• AWARD if at least ONE of the following appears:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” anywhere on the page, OR
  – the text “x=1” anywhere on the page, OR
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot on the axis; a “1” written near the axis without a dot; a bare crossing of the curve through the x-axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks or generic marks.
• Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if ALL of the following base conditions hold:
  1) The chosen curve is **monotone increasing** on its drawn branch, and
  2) It is **concave down** over most of the visible branch.
• AND at least **one** of the two behavior cues holds (→ require 3 of 4 cues total):
  3) The **left end** approaches the y-axis (x close to 0⁺) more steeply than the right end (i.e., left is “more vertical”, right is “flatter”), and/or
  4) The **left end** heads downward (toward negative y) as it nears the y-axis, while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) for any of: obvious exponential (concave up), nearly straight line with no visible curvature, decreasing behavior, hyperbolic-looking branch that tracks along the y-axis, or a branch that extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award is allowed only when the ends clearly bend and the steep-to-flat pattern is evident (e.g., S17-type). Otherwise C=0.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from curve crossing alone. If the explicit evidence list is missing, set B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C, B, A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, labels like “h⁻¹” that overlap the curve. These are not the curve.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

HARD RULES ABOUT AXES
• If either Cartesian axis is absent, unusably faint/erased, or the curve is drawn off-axes: assign 0/3 (A=0, B=0, C=0). Do NOT infer from the curve alone.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES
• If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, DEFAULT to 0/3 unless ALL are true:
  (i) the inverse curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke,
  (ii) other curve(s) can be ignored without any ambiguity, and
  (iii) EVERY piece of evidence used for A/B/C is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve itself.
• If any doubt remains (curve identities, shared/ambiguous labels, or which curve crosses/approaches which axis), assign 0/3.
• NEVER borrow labels/coordinates from a different curve to award any mark.

CURVE SELECTION (when not zeroed by the rule above)
• Grade ONLY the inverse curve “h⁻¹”. If no label exists, choose the curve that approaches the y-axis from the RIGHT and lies in/near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit, treat as ambiguous ⇒ 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks → total 0–3)  [A first, then B, then C]
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0)
• AWARD if the entire h⁻¹ curve stays in x>0.
• Touching/overlap due to line thickness, a tiny nib, or a smudge is OK (still award).
• DEDUCT ONLY if a continuous segment of the h⁻¹ stroke lies on or left of x=0, OR the curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
• Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A lone plotted point left of the axis (e.g., (½;−1)) does NOT cause a deduction.
• DEPENDENCY: If A=0 because the curve runs along the y-axis or enters x≤0, set C=0 (a valid base-2 log cannot live in x≤0).

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0)  [STRICT EVIDENCE; OWNERSHIP REQUIRED]
• AWARD only if at least ONE is observed AND clearly attached to the h⁻¹ curve:
  – the text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (note the order 1 then 0), or
  – the text “x=1”, or
  – a dot/crossing on the x-axis at x≈1 WITH a nearby explicit “1” label.
• DO NOT award for: unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing; “(0;1)”; “(½;−1)”; “2”; ticks/generic marks; labels that plausibly belong to another curve.
• Tolerance (for the labeled dot/crossing): accept positions within 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing.

Check C — Logarithmic shape (base 2)
• AWARD only if BOTH base conditions hold:
  1) monotone increasing on its visible branch, AND
  2) concave down over a clear majority of the branch (not mostly straight).
• AND at least ONE behavior cue is evident:
  3) left end near x→0⁺ markedly steeper than the right tail, and/or
  4) left end trends toward negative y while the right tail flattens as x increases.
• DEDUCT (C=0) if the h⁻¹ candidate looks hyperbolic (tracks along an axis), is concave up (exponential-like), nearly straight, decreasing, or extends visibly into x≤0.
• Borderline award allowed only when ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise C=0.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (required before deciding)
• Before assigning marks, extract what you SEE for each student:
  – Axes: present/absent.
  – Curve count on the axes: <number>; h⁻¹ label present? <yes/no>.
  – Left-of-y evidence: “none / tiny nib / continuous segment length≈<…>”.
  – X-intercept tokens (quote verbatim in order): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
  – Accepted for B (and why attached to h⁻¹): <list/none>.
  – Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
• If you cannot quote an acceptable token for B, set B=0. If you cannot rule out left-of-axis contact except for smudge/thickness, AWARD A.

CONSISTENCY CHECK (must pass)
• ErrorTags must be [shape(C), x_intercept(B), asymptote(A)] as 0/1.
• Mark must equal the sum of ErrorTags (0–3). If not, adjust the mark to match the tags.

TIE-BREAKERS
• Never infer B from crossing alone. Without an acceptable token, B=0.
• “1/3” should be rare: use it only when exactly one of C,B,A clearly holds.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).

Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]

Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]

Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.

The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).
Grading Procedure and Output Format
For each student graph you are given, follow this exact procedure. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.
Check Foundational Requirements. If they fail, assign 0/3 and stop.
Analyze Shape, X-Intercept, and Asymptote using the rubric.
Calculate the final mark and generate the output in the strict format below.
Exemplar Analyses
Here are examples of how to apply the refined rubric.
Student S5:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear. It lacks the clear and continuous concave down curvature required for a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3
Error Tags: [0, 1, 1]
Student S13:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not demonstrate the asymptotic behavior, as it does not approach the y-axis.
Final Mark: 0/3
Error Tags: [0, 0, 0]
Student S24:
Shape: 0/1. Reason: Foundational requirement not met. No axes are drawn, so the properties of the graph cannot be verified.
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the x-intercept cannot be shown.
Asymptote: 0/1. Reason: No axes are drawn, so the asymptote cannot be shown.

A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis) to be eligible for any marks. If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning should state that axes are required to demonstrate the graph's properties.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
You will assess each graph against the following three criteria. Award 1 mark for each criterion met.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The function is strictly increasing.
The graph displays clear and continuous concave down curvature. A slight but noticeable curve throughout is sufficient.
The overall trend is correct, even if drawn with slightly linear segments connecting key points (e.g., connecting (1/2, -1), (1,0), (2,1)).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear, showing only a minor bend at one end instead of a continuous curve.
The graph is concave up (bending upwards, like a U-shape) or an incorrect function type.
The graph has a clear starting point on the x-axis (e.g., at (1,0)) and does not extend downwards towards the vertical asymptote. A complete shape must show behavior on both sides of the x-axis.
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A clear dot is placed at the intersection on the x-axis, and the number 1 is written on the x-axis at that exact point.
The graph clearly and unambiguously passes through the point on the x-axis labeled '1'.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if ALL of the following are true):
The intercept is clearly at a different x-value or on the y-axis.
The intercept is not marked at all (no dot, no number, no coordinate).
The label is incorrect (e.g., (0,1)).
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not touch or cross it for its entire length.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision. Also, award the mark if the line barely crosses the y-axis for the specific purpose of connecting to a correctly plotted point near the axis (like (1/2, -1)).

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For each student 1..26 output exactly the block below — no extra prose, no blank lines.
The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

Student <number>
Mark: `<X>/3`
ErrorTags: [shape,x_intercept,asymptote] as [0/1,0/1,0/1]
Findings:
• Axes: <present/absent>; Curves on axes: <n>; h⁻¹ label: <yes/no>.
• Left-of-y evidence: <none/tiny nib/continuous segment ~…>.
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): <list>; Accepted for X: <list/none>.
• Curvature summary: <one clause>.
Reasons:
• Shape: <why 1 or 0 per curvature cues>.
• x-intercept: <why 1 or 0 based on accepted tokens attached to h⁻¹>.
• Asymptote: <why 1 or 0; mention continuous left-of-axis or its absence>.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
(two full curves on the same axes; h⁻¹ hugs/runs along y-axis): evidence belongs to other curve(s); h⁻¹ shows hyperbolic behavior and y-axis contact → Shape=0, X=0, Asymptote=0 ⇒ Final 0/3.
(mostly straight, then kicks up; contact at origin or left-of-y): Shape=0 (straight/piecewise & concave-up end); X=0 (no valid token); Asymptote=0 (clear point contact at y-axis/left segment) ⇒ 0/3.
(good memo-like): clear concave-down increase; “(1;0)” marked for h⁻¹; no continuous left-of-axis stroke → 3/3.
(multi-curve; no X token for h⁻¹): even if Shape and Asymptote look okay, X=0 (no acceptable token attached to h⁻¹) ⇒ at most 2/3.
No axes (S24-type): Rule 0 triggers → 0/3.
“(0;1)” is not “(1;0)”; do not repurpose; only accept “(1;0)”/“x=1” (or labeled dot at x≈1) attached to h⁻¹.",APE,GPT-4.1,Group1,0.9,,
