Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is overall increasing and concave down, matching the correct log shape.  
• x-intercept: There is no explicit “(1;0)” coordinate, “x=1”, or labeled dot at x=1, so this is not awarded.  
• Asymptote: The curve does not cross into x<0, so the asymptote is correct.

ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:
