Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is overall increasing and concave down, matching the log shape.  
• x-intercept: There is no explicit “(1;0)”, “x=1”, or labeled dot at x=1, so no evidence for the intercept.  
• Asymptote: The curve does not cross into x<0; it approaches but stays right of the y-axis.

Student 2  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The drawn curve is increasing and concave down, typical for a log function.

• Asymptote: The curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.

Student 3  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve increases and is concave down, so the log shape is present.
