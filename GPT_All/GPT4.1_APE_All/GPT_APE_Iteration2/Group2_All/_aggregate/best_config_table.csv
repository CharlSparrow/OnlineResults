Your goal is to grade the following hand-drawn graphs with maximum accuracy and consistency, using the provided rubric and exemplars as your definitive guide.
Rule 0: Foundational Prerequisite
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis clearly visible) to be eligible for any marks.
If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning for each category should state that the property cannot be verified without axes. Do not evaluate any other rules.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
If Rule 0 is met, assess the graph against the following three criteria.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph shows a continuous, gentle curve that is clearly not drawn with a straight edge.
The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear concave down curvature.
The graph connects key points (e.g., (1,0) and (2,1)) with a visible arc, not a straight line. (See Exemplar S7).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear or looks like it was drawn with a ruler, even if slightly wavy. If it appears a student connected two points with a straight line, it is incorrect. (See Exemplar S5).
The graph is concave up (incorrect curvature).
The shape is fundamentally wrong (e.g., exponential, parabolic).
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A dot is placed on the x-axis precisely at the '1' tick mark, and the graph passes through it.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are present):
The graph visibly misses the '1' mark, even if it is close. Ambiguity or clear inaccuracy here results in no mark.
The intercept is not marked at all, or is marked at a different value.
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph clearly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision.
Exemplar Analyses (Based on Problematic Cases)
Use these specific examples as your primary reference for applying the rules.
Exemplar 1: Student S5
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear, appearing to connect the points (1/2, -1) and (1,0) with a straight line. It lacks the required continuous, gentle curve of a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly and clearly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For EACH student 1..26, output exactly this block — no extra prose, no blank lines between fields, and do not restate other students’ marks. The token “/3” must appear exactly once in each student’s block.

Your goal is to grade the following hand-drawn graphs with maximum accuracy and consistency, using the provided rubric and exemplars as your definitive guide.
Rule 0: Foundational Prerequisite
A graph must be drawn on a Cartesian plane (with at least an x and y-axis clearly visible) to be eligible for any marks.
If no axes are present, the final mark is automatically 0/3. The reasoning for each category should state that the property cannot be verified without axes. Do not evaluate any other rules.
Detailed Grading Rubric (3 Marks Total)
If Rule 0 is met, assess the graph against the following three criteria.
1. Shape (Vorm) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph shows a continuous, gentle curve that is clearly not drawn with a straight edge.
The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear concave down curvature.
The graph connects key points (e.g., (1,0) and (2,1)) with a visible arc, not a straight line. (See Exemplar S7).
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are clearly present):
The graph is predominantly linear or looks like it was drawn with a ruler, even if slightly wavy. If it appears a student connected two points with a straight line, it is incorrect. (See Exemplar S5).
The graph is concave up (incorrect curvature).
The shape is fundamentally wrong (e.g., exponential, parabolic).
2. X-Intercept (x-afsnit) - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark for ANY of these):
The coordinate pair (1;0) is written on or near the intercept point.
A dot is placed on the x-axis precisely at the '1' tick mark, and the graph passes through it.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark if these are present):
The graph visibly misses the '1' mark, even if it is close. Ambiguity or clear inaccuracy here results in no mark.
The intercept is not marked at all, or is marked at a different value.
3. Asymptote - 1 Mark
Positive Indicators (Award mark if these are present):
The graph clearly approaches the y-axis (x=0) from the right and descends alongside it without crossing.
Negative Indicators (Deduct mark ONLY if this is clearly intentional):
The graph shows a clear and continuous trend extending into the negative x-quadrants.
Leniency Rule: Award the mark if the line gets very close to or slightly ""smudges"" across the y-axis due to drawing imprecision.
Exemplar Analyses (Based on Problematic Cases)
Use these specific examples as your primary reference for applying the rules.
Exemplar 1: Student S5
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The graph is predominantly linear, appearing to connect the points (1/2, -1) and (1,0) with a straight line. It lacks the required continuous, gentle curve of a logarithmic function.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly and clearly labeled with the coordinate pair (1,0).
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph correctly approaches the y-axis from the right without crossing it.
Final Mark: 2/3

Exemplar 2: Student S7
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph demonstrates a clear, continuous, gentle curve that is concave down. It is visibly an arc and not a straight line, satisfying the shape requirement.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is correctly marked with a dot and labeled with the coordinate (1,0).

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For EACH student 1..26, output exactly this block — no extra prose, no blank lines between fields, and do not restate other students’ marks. The token “/3” must appear exactly once in each student’s block.
