Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing and concave down, matching the log-shape.  
• x-intercept: There is no explicit evidence at x=1 (no dot or label at (1;0)), so the intercept is not awarded.  
• Asymptote: The curve does not cross into x<0, so the asymptote condition is satisfied.  

Student 2  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,1,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is increasing and concave down, matching the log-shape.

• Asymptote: The curve does not cross into x<0, so the asymptote is correct.  

Student 3  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is increasing and concave down, consistent with a log function.

ErrorTags: [1,0,1]

Mark: `0/3`
