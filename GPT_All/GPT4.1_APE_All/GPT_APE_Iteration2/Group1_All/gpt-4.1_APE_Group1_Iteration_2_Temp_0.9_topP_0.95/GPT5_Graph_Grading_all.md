Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [0/1,1/1,1/1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing and concave down, but slightly too straight between (½;−1) and (2;1) compared to a true log shape.  
• x-intercept: There is a visible dot and the label (1;0) directly at x=1 on the x-axis.  
• Asymptote: The curve does not cross into x<0; it approaches the y-axis from the right.

Student 2  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1/1,1/1,1/1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is increasing and concave down, with the steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.  
• x-intercept: There is a clear dot at (1;0) labeled explicitly on the x-axis.  
• Asymptote: The curve approaches but does not cross the y-axis.

Student 3  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1/1,1/1,0/1]  
Reasons:

• x-intercept: There is a labeled dot at (1;0) on the x-axis, so this is awarded.
