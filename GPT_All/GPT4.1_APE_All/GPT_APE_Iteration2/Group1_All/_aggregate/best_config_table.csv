Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the inverse logarithmic function (base 2) against the attached memorandum drawing. Grade each student independently.

SCORING (three binary checks → total is 0–3)
Check A — Asymptote at the y-axis (x=0):
  • AWARD if the curve does NOT clearly cross into x<0.
  • Touching/overlapping the axis line because of thickness is OK (still award).
  • Ignore axis arrowheads/ticks/labels; those are not the curve.
  • DEDUCT only if a drawn portion of the curve lies left of the y-axis.

Check B — x-intercept exactly at (1;0):
  • AWARD only with explicit evidence at x≈1 on the x-axis:
    – a dot/crossing at the x-axis with a nearby “1”, or
    – the coordinate (1;0)/(1,0), or
    – the text “x=1”.
  • Tolerance: accept 0.9–1.1 of the tick spacing as “at 1”.
  • DO NOT award for: “(0;1)” (that is y-intercept), “(½;−1)”, “2”, or unlabeled nearby dots.
  • If ambiguous or unreadable → DO NOT award. (Evidence required.)

Check C — Log-shape (base >1):
  • AWARD if overall increasing and concave down: steep rise near x→0⁺ and flattening to the right.
  • Hand sketches may be rough; if ends bend and the curve is monotone increasing, AWARD (e.g., S17-type).
  • DEDUCT for clear exponential (concave up), a straight line with no visible curvature, or a decreasing curve.

WHAT TO IGNORE
• Page ruling, smudges, erasures, stray pencil marks, labels such as “h⁻¹”, and axis arrowheads/ticks.
• If multiple candidates exist, choose the curve nearest the first quadrant that approaches the y-axis from the right.
• The memo’s marked point (½;−1) is a reference point, NOT an intercept — do not use it to award B.

TIE-BREAKERS / CALIBRATION
• Never infer B from shape alone. Missing labels/dots → B=0.
• Only output “1/3” when exactly one of A,B,C is clearly satisfied and the other two clearly fail. If evidence for a second check is uncertain, prefer “2/3” or “0/3” as the checks justify — do not guess.
