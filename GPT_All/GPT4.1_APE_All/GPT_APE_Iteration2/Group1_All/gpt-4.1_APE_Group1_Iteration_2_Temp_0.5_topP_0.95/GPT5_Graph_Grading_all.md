Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [0/1,1/1,1/1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is overall increasing and concave down, but slightly flattens near the top, so the log shape is not perfect but acceptable.  
• x-intercept: There is no explicit evidence marking the x-intercept at (1;0), only (0;1) and (½;−1) are labeled.  
• Asymptote: The curve does not cross into x<0, so the asymptote at the y-axis is correct.  

Student 2  
Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1/1,1/1,1/1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is increasing and concave down, matching the correct log shape.

Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [1/1,0/1,1/1]  
Reasons:
