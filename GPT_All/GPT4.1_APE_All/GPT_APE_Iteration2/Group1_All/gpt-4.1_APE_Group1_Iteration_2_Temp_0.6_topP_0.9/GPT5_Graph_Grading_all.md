Student 1  
Mark: `2/3`  
ErrorTags: [0/1,1/1,1/1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is increasing and concave down, but the flattening to the right is not very pronounced.  
• x-intercept: There is a clear dot at (1;0) with a label, so explicit evidence is present.  
• Asymptote: The curve does not cross into x<0, so the asymptote is correct.

Mark: `3/3`  
ErrorTags: [1/1,1/1,1/1]  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The curve is monotone increasing and concave down, matching the expected log shape.  
• x-intercept: The point (1;0) is clearly marked as the x-intercept.

ErrorTags: [1/1,0/1,1/1]  
Reasons:
