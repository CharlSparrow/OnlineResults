S13:  
Shape: 0/1. Reason: The shape is incomplete. The graph has a clear starting point at (1,0) and does not show the required behavior of extending downwards towards the vertical asymptote as x approaches 0.  
X-Intercept: 0/1. Reason: The graph does not pass through an x-intercept; it incorrectly starts at this point.
