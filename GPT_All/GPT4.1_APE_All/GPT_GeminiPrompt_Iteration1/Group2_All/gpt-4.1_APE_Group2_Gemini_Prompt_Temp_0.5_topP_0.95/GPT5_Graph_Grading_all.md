Student S21:
Shape: 1/1. Reason: The graph is strictly increasing and displays clear, continuous concave down curvature throughout, matching the expected logarithmic form.
X-Intercept: 1/1. Reason: The x-intercept is clearly marked at (1,0), with the coordinate written at the correct point.
Asymptote: 1/1. Reason: The graph approaches the y-axis (x=0) but does not cross or touch it for its entire length.
Final Mark: 3/3
