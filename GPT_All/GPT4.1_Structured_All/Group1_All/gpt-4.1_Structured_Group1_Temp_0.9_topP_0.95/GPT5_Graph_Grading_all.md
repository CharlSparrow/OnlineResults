Here are the grades for each student's graph based on the memorandum and the rubric provided:

#### Exemplar reference:
- **Memo:** 3/3 (Perfect example)
- **S1:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape, but correct asymptote and x-intercept)
- **S6:** 0/3 (Exponential, not log; wrong shape, crosses y-axis, no correct intercept)

---

---

#### S26
**0/3**  
- Blank (no attempt)
