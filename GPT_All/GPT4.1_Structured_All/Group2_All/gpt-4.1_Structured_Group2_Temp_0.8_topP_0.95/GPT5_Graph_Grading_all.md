Below is the grading for each student's graph, following the memo and the examples provided:

---

### Reference:
- **Memo:** 3/3 (Perfect: Correct shape, correct x-intercept at (1;0), does not cross y-axis)
- **S1:** 2/3 (Incorrect shape, but correct x-intercept and respects y-asymptote)
- **S6:** 0/3 (Exponential, wrong shape, does not indicate x-intercept, violates asymptote)

---

### Marking the students:

#### 1. S1 — 2/3  
*Reasoning:* Incorrect shape, but shows the correct x-intercept and does not cross the y-axis.

#### 2. S2 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct logarithmic shape, intersection at (1;0) shown, does not cross the y-axis.

#### 3. S3 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct logarithmic shape, intersection at (1;0) shown, respects the asymptote.

#### 4. S4 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 5. S5 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), respects asymptote.

#### 6. S6 — 0/3  
*Reasoning:* Exponential shape, no x-intercept at (1;0), violates y-asymptote.

#### 7. S7 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 8. S8 — 1/3  
*Reasoning:* Shape is not logarithmic (appears exponential), x-intercept not at (1;0), does not cross y-axis (so gets 1 mark).

#### 9. S9 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 10. S10 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 11. S11 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 12. S12 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 13. S13 — 1/3  
*Reasoning:* Shape is wrong (skewed straight, not log), no x-intercept at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 14. S14 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 15. S15 — 1/3  
*Reasoning:* Shape is wrong (exponential), intersection not at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 16. S16 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 17. S17 — 2/3  
*Reasoning:* Shape is more straight, not perfectly logarithmic, but intersection at (1;0) and does not cross y-axis.

#### 18. S18 — 2/3  
*Reasoning:* Shape is too flat, intersection at (1;0) not shown, but does not cross y-axis. (Ambiguity in shape, but leans towards not correct.)

#### 19. S19 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct log shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 20. S20 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 21. S21 — 3/3  
*Reasoning:* Correct shape, intersection at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 22. S22 — 0/3  
*Reasoning:* Not a log graph, no x-intercept, does not respect asymptote.

#### 23. S23 — 1/3  
*Reasoning:* Line, not a logarithmic shape. No x-intercept, does not cross y-axis.

#### 24. S24 — 2/3  
*Reasoning:* General log-like shape, does not show x-intercept at (1;0), does not cross y-axis.

#### 25. S25 — 0/3  
*Reasoning:* No graph drawn, only a written request (does not fulfill criteria).

#### 26. S26 — 0/3  
*Reasoning:* Blank (no answer provided).
