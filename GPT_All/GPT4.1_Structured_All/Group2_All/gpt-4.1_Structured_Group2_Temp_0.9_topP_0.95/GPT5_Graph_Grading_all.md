Let's grade each graph according to the memo and your instructions:

---

**Memo Reference:**  
- 1 mark: Correct logarithmic **shape** (similar to memo: rising curve, rightwards above x-axis)
- 1 mark: Correct **x-axis intersection** shown (at (1,0) or clearly indicated)
- 1 mark: Correct **asymptote**, does **not** cross y-axis (if ambiguous, award mark)

---

### Grading

**S1**: 2/3  
- Shape is incorrect (not log curve), but x-intercept and asymptote respected.

**S2**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0) is clearly marked, and does not cross y-axis.

**S3**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0) is marked, does not cross y-axis.

**S4**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0) is marked, does not cross y-axis.

**S5**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0) is marked, does not cross y-axis.

**S6**: 0/3  
- (As per your example) Drew exponential graph, not logarithmic.

**S7**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0) is marked, does not cross y-axis.

**S8**: 2/3  
- Shape is incorrect (not a typical log curve: looks more linear at first then rises sharply), x-intercept not clearly marked, but does not cross y-axis.

**S9**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S10**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S11**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S12**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S13**: 2/3  
- Shape is roughly correct, x-intercept not clearly marked (starts above x-axis), does not cross y-axis.

**S14**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S15**: 2/3  
- Shape is incorrect (exponential), but (1,0) is marked, does not cross y-axis.

**S16**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S17**: 2/3  
- Shape is not smoothly logarithmic, but (1,0) is marked, does not cross y-axis.

**S18**: 2/3  
- Shape flattens too much, not a good log shape, but asymptote and intercept (not clearly marked at (1,0), but close).

**S19**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S20**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S21**: 3/3  
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), does not cross y-axis.

**S22**: 0/3  
- Not a log graph, no intercept or asymptote indication.

**S23**: 1/3  
- Only shape is somewhat similar to log, no axis or intercept labeled.

**S24**: 1/3  
- Only shape is somewhat similar to log, no axis or intercept labeled.

**S25**: 0/3  
- No graph drawn (instructions only).

**S26**: 0/3  
- Blank, no graph.
