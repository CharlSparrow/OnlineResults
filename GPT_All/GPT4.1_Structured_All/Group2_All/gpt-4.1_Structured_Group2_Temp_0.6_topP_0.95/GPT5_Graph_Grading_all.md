Here are the marks for each student's graph, according to the provided memorandum and exemplars:

---

#### **Memo Reference**
- **3/3:** Correct logarithmic shape, x-intercept at (1;0), respects y-asymptote.

---

### **Grading**

#### **S1:**  
**2/3**  
- Shape is incorrect (as per exemplar), but x-intercept and asymptote are correct.

#### **S2:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) clearly shown, does not cross y-axis.

#### **S3:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) clearly indicated, respects y-asymptote.

#### **S4:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct logarithmic shape, (1;0) shown, does not cross y-axis.

#### **S5:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, asymptote respected.

#### **S6:**  
**0/3**  
- Exponential graph, not logarithmic, violates all criteria (as per exemplar).

#### **S7:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, does not cross y-axis.

#### **S8:**  
**2/3**  
- Shape is not correct (looks almost linear at first, not logarithmic), but does not cross y-axis and attempts x-intercept (though not labeled at (1;0)).

#### **S9:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S10:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S11:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S12:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S13:**  
**2/3**  
- Shape is not correct (lower part missing), but attempts x-intercept and respects asymptote.

#### **S14:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S15:**  
**2/3**  
- Correct x-intercept marked, but shape is not correct (does not show left side clearly), does not cross y-axis.

#### **S16:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S17:**  
**2/3**  
- Shape is not correct (too straight), but x-intercept and asymptote are shown.

#### **S18:**  
**2/3**  
- Shape is not correct (too flat on right), but does not cross y-axis and attempts x-intercept (though not at (1;0)).

#### **S19:**  
**0/3**  
- Exponential graph drawn (as per S6).

#### **S20:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S21:**  
**3/3**  
- Correct shape, (1;0) shown, respects asymptote.

#### **S22:**  
**0/3**  
- Not a logarithmic graph, does not show intercept or asymptote.

#### **S23:**  
**1/3**  
- Only the shape is attempted, but missing intercept and asymptote is ambiguous.

#### **S24:**  
**2/3**  
- Shape is mostly correct, but no x-intercept marked.

#### **S25:**  
**0/3**  
- No graph provided, only a written request.

#### **S26:**  
**0/3**  
- No graph provided.
