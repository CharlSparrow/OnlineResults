Let's grade each graph out of 3, using the memo and exemplars for guidance:

### Memo Recap:
1. **Shape (vorm)**: Must be a logarithmic curve, increasing and tending to the right, not a straight line or exponential.
2. **X-intercept (x-afsnit)**: Must show or label (1;0) or indicate the intersection clearly.
3. **Asymptote (assimptoot)**: Should not cross the y-axis; ambiguity in a hand-drawn graph goes to the student's favor.
