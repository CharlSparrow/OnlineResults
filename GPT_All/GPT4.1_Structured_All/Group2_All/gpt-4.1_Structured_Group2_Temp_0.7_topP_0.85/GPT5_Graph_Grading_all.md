Let's grade each student's graph out of 3 using the memorandum and the example grades provided:

---

**S1:**  
- Shape: Incorrect (not a logarithmic curve, looks linear/affine)  
- X-intercept: Correctly indicated  
- Asymptote: Not violated  
**Grade:** 2/3 *(matches the provided S1 example)*

---

**S2:**  
- Shape: Correct (logarithmic curve)  
- X-intercept: Correct, marked (1;0)  
- Asymptote: Not violated  
**Grade:** 3/3

---

**Grade:** 1/3 (only the asymptote mark)

---

**S9:**

- Asymptote: Not violated  
**Grade:** 3/3

---

**S13:**

---

**S19:**

---

**S21:**  
- Shape: Correct

- Asymptote: Not violated  
**Grade:** 1/3

---

**S23:**  
- Shape: Incorrect (straight line)  
- X-intercept: Not marked  
- Asymptote: Not violated  
**Grade:** 1/3

---

**S24:**  
- Shape: Correct  
- X-intercept: Not marked  
- Asymptote: Not violated  
**Grade:** 2/3

---

**S25:**  
- No graph, only a request for full marks  
**Grade:** 0/3

---

**S26:**  
- No graph at all  
**Grade:** 0/3

If you need a table for easy copy-pasting, here it is:

| S3      | 3         |
| S4      | 3         |
| S5      | 3         |
| S6      | 0         |
