Let's grade each graph out of 3, using the memorandum and the provided rubric:

**Memo (Exemplar - 3/3):**
- Correct shape (logarithmic, rising to the right)
- Correct x-intercept (1;0) clearly indicated
- Asymptote respected (does not cross y-axis)

---

- Asymptote: Not violated
**Grade: 3/3**

- X-intercept: Correctly shown (1;0)
- Asymptote: Not violated
**Grade: 3/3**
