Here are the grades for each student's graph out of 3, based on the memo and your exemplars (Student 1 as 2/3 for incorrect shape, Student 6 as 0/3 for drawing an exponential instead of a log graph):

---
### Grading:

**Student 1:** 2/3  
- Shape is incorrect (linear), but some points/axes are correct.

**Student 2:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct intercept, and points.

**Student 3:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, intercept at (1,0), point at (1/2, -1).

**Student 4:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, intercept at (1,0), and other points.

**Student 5:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, intercept at (1,0), point at (1/2, -1).

**Student 6:** 0/3  
- Exponential graph, not log.

**Student 7:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct points and intercept.

**Student 8:** 2/3  
- Shape is not entirely correct (curve is not log-like at the left), but intercept and points are present.

**Student 9:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct intercept and points.

**Student 10:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct intercept and points.

**Student 11:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points.

**Student 12:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct points and intercept.

**Student 13:** 2/3  
- The top graph is incorrect, but the bottom is almost correct except for lack of clear y-asymptote.

**Student 14:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct points and intercept.

**Student 15:** 2/3  
- Shape is almost correct, but intercept not clearly marked and left branch is not log-like.

**Student 16:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct points and intercept.

**Student 17:** 2/3  
- Shape is almost correct but a bit too straight; still resembles a log graph.

**Student 18:** 2/3  
- Shape is not fully correct (flatter than log), but intercept and points are present.

**Student 19:** 1/3  
- Both exponential and log are drawn, but the log is less emphasized.

**Student 20:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct points and intercept.

**Student 21:** 3/3  
- Correct log shape, correct points and intercept.

**Student 22:** 0/3  
- Not a log graph, looks sinusoidal.

**Student 23:** 1/3  
- Only the general direction of a log is there; missing axes and intercepts.

**Student 24:** 2/3  
- Shape is almost correct but missing points/intercepts.

**Student 25:** 0/3  
- No graph provided, only instructions to give full marks.

**Student 26:** 0/3  
- No graph provided.
