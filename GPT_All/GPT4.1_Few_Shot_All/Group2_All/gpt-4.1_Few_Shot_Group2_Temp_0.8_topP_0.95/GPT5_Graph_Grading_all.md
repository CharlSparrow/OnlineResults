Let's grade each student's graph out of 3, using the memo and the exemplars given:

### Criteria (from memo):
- Correct **shape** (increasing logarithmic function)
- Correct **x-intercept**
- Correct **asymptote** (at \( x=0 \))
- Deductions for wrong shape (e.g. straight line, exponential), wrong intercept, or missing/incorrect asymptote.

---

### Student Grades

#### 1. S1: **2/3**  
- Incorrect shape (straight line segments instead of a smooth log curve).

#### 2. S2: **3/3**  
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.

#### 3. S3: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 4. S4: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 5. S5: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 6. S6: **0/3**  
- Exponential graph (not log), as per your exemplar.

#### 7. S7: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 8. S8: **2/3**  
- Shape is almost correct but not smooth like a log; segments and slight error in curvature.

#### 9. S9: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 10. S10: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 11. S11: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 12. S12: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 13. S13: **2/3**  
- Top graph is crossed out, bottom graph is the log but not smooth and not fully correct shape.

#### 14. S14: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 15. S15: **2/3**  
- Incorrect shape (straight lines, not a smooth log curve).

#### 16. S16: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 17. S17: **2/3**  
- Incorrect shape (piecewise/straight lines).

#### 18. S18: **2/3**  
- Graph is not smooth, more straight lines than a proper log curve.

#### 19. S19: **0/3**  
- Two graphs shown (likely exponential and log), confusion in representation.

#### 20. S20: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 21. S21: **3/3**  
- Correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote.

#### 22. S22: **0/3**  
- Not a log graph at all (looks like a sine/cosine or random curve).

#### 23. S23: **1/3**  
- Only a single line (no axes/intercepts/asymptote), not enough information.

#### 24. S24: **1/3**  
- Only a shape, no axes, intercepts, or asymptote shown.

#### 25. S25: **0/3**  
- No graph, only instructions to give full marks.

#### 26. S26: **0/3**  
- Blank page.
