Let's mark each student graph according to the memo and the given exemplars:
- **3/3:** Correct log shape, correct intercepts/asymptote.
- **2/3:** Shape is not entirely correct but effort or some correct features.
- **0/3:** Incorrect graph type (e.g. exponential), no relevant features.

### Marking

#### **Student 1**  
- Score: **2/3** (Incorrect shape, as per your example.)

#### **Student 2**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 3**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 4**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 5**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 6**  
- Score: **0/3** (Exponential graph, not a log, as per your example.)

#### **Student 7**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 8**  
- Score: **2/3** (Shape mostly correct, but left end is slightly off and doesn't show vertical asymptote clearly.)

#### **Student 9**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 10**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 11**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 12**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 13**  
- Score: **2/3** (Lower graph incorrect and scribbled out, upper graph: log shape but missing axes/intercepts labeling.)

#### **Student 14**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 15**  
- Score: **2/3** (Shape is more exponential, left end is not asymptotic, but at least goes through (2,1) and (4,2).)

#### **Student 16**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 17**  
- Score: **2/3** (Mostly linear, not a true log shape.)

#### **Student 18**  
- Score: **2/3** (Correct x-intercepts, but right end is too horizontal, not a proper log curve.)

#### **Student 19**  
- Score: **0/3** (Drawn both exponential and log, unclear intention, both graphs shown.)

#### **Student 20**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 21**  
- Score: **3/3** (Correct log shape, intercepts, asymptote shown.)

#### **Student 22**  
- Score: **0/3** (Curve does not resemble a logarithmic function.)

#### **Student 23**  
- Score: **1/3** (No axes or intercepts, only a curve, no detail.)

#### **Student 24**  
- Score: **1/3** (No axes or intercepts, only a curve, no detail.)

#### **Student 25**  
- Score: **0/3** (No graph drawn.)

#### **Student 26**  
- Score: **0/3** (Nothing drawn.)
