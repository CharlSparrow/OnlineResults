Let's grade each student according to the memo (last image), using the examples you provided:
- **3/3:** Correct shape (increasing log function), correct x-intercept, and asymptote.
- **2/3:** Incorrect shape but attempted correct features (like S1).
- **0/3:** Completely wrong type of graph (e.g., exponential, as in S6) or no attempt.

### Grading:

#### 1. S1
- **2/3** (Incorrect shape, as noted)

#### 2. S2
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 3. S3
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 4. S4
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 5. S5
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 6. S6
- **0/3** (Exponential, not log)

#### 7. S7
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 8. S8
- **2/3** (Shape is a bit off—almost linear then sharp up—does not show correct log curve especially on left side)

#### 9. S9
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 10. S10
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 11. S11
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 12. S12
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 13. S13
- **2/3** (Shape is not perfect, but the lower graph resembles a log function)

#### 14. S14
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 15. S15
- **2/3** (Shape incorrect, looks almost exponential)

#### 16. S16
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 17. S17
- **2/3** (Incorrect shape, almost straight/linear for too long)

#### 18. S18
- **2/3** (Incorrect shape, curve flattens too much on the right, and does not go down properly on the left)

#### 19. S19
- **0/3** (Also includes another incorrect function, not a single log graph)

#### 20. S20
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 21. S21
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts)

#### 22. S22
- **0/3** (Not a log graph, wavy line)

#### 23. S23
- **0/3** (Not a log graph, straight line)

#### 24. S24
- **2/3** (Almost correct, but not enough detail or intercepts/labeling)

#### 25. S25
- **0/3** (No graph drawn, only written instructions)

#### 26. S26
- **0/3** (Blank)
