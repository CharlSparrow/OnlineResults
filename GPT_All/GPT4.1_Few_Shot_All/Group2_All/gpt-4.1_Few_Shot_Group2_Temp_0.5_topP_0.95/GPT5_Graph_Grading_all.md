Let's grade each student's graph out of 3, using the memo (last image) as the perfect example (3/3), and the exemplars you described:

- **3/3**: Correct increasing logarithmic shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote.
- **2/3**: Minor error (e.g. shape a bit off, but still recognizably a log graph).
- **0/3**: Completely incorrect (e.g. drew an exponential, not a log graph, or no answer).

### Grades:

#### 1. ![S1](attachment:image1)
- **2/3** (Shape is incorrect, as per your note.)

#### 2. ![S2](attachment:image2)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 3. ![S3](attachment:image3)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 4. ![S4](attachment:image4)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 5. ![S5](attachment:image5)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 6. ![S6](attachment:image6)
- **0/3** (Exponential, not log as required.)

#### 7. ![S7](attachment:image7)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 8. ![S8](attachment:image8)
- **2/3** (Shape is not quite correct, more exponential than logarithmic.)

#### 9. ![S9](attachment:image9)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 10. ![S10](attachment:image10)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 11. ![S11](attachment:image11)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 12. ![S12](attachment:image12)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 13. ![S13](attachment:image13)
- **2/3** (Shape is not quite correct, line is too straight.)

#### 14. ![S14](attachment:image14)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 15. ![S15](attachment:image15)
- **2/3** (Shape is not quite correct, more exponential.)

#### 16. ![S16](attachment:image16)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 17. ![S17](attachment:image17)
- **2/3** (Shape is not quite correct, too straight.)

#### 18. ![S18](attachment:image18)
- **2/3** (Shape is not quite correct, too flat at the right.)

#### 19. ![S19](attachment:image19)
- **0/3** (Shows two graphs, neither is a correct log graph.)

#### 20. ![S20](attachment:image20)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 21. ![S21](attachment:image21)
- **3/3** (Correct log shape, correct intercepts.)

#### 22. ![S22](attachment:image22)
- **0/3** (Not a log graph at all.)

#### 23. ![S23](attachment:image23)
- **0/3** (No axes, no intercepts, just a curve.)

#### 24. ![S24](attachment:image24)
- **2/3** (No axes or intercepts, but the shape is log-like.)

#### 25. ![S25](attachment:image25)
- **0/3** (No graph, just a request for full marks.)

#### 26. ![S26](attachment:image26)
- **0/3** (No answer.)
