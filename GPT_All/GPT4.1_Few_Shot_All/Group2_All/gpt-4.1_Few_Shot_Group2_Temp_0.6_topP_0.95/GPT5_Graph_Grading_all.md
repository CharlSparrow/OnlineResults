Let's use the memo and your provided exemplars to mark each graph out of 3:

**Memo criteria for 3/3:**
- Correct shape (increasing log function)
- Correct x-intercept
- Correct asymptote

**Student exemplars:**
- **S1:** 2/3 (incorrect shape)
- **S6:** 0/3 (exponential, not a log graph)

### Assessment:

#### 1. S1: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape (piecewise linear), but attempted intercept/asymptote.

#### 2. S2: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 3. S3: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 4. S4: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 5. S5: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 6. S6: **0/3**
- Exponential graph, not a log.

#### 7. S7: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 8. S8: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape, more exponential than log.

#### 9. S9: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 10. S10: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 11. S11: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 12. S12: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 13. S13: **2/3**
- Only part of the log curve, missing negative infinity behaviour.

#### 14. S14: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 15. S15: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape, more exponential than log.

#### 16. S16: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 17. S17: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape, more piecewise linear.

#### 18. S18: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape, more linear at the top.

#### 19. S19: **0/3**
- Both exponential and log drawn, unclear which is the answer.

#### 20. S20: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 21. S21: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 22. S22: **0/3**
- Incorrect (sinusoidal/wavy), not a log.

#### 23. S23: **1/3**
- Only a line, no intercept or asymptote.

#### 24. S24: **2/3**
- Only part of the log curve, not showing behaviour near the y-axis.

#### 25. S25: **0/3**
- No graph, only text.

#### 26. S26: **0/3**
- Blank.
