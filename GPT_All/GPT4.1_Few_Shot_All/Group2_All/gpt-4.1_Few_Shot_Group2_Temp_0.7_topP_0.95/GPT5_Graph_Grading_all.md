Let's apply the rubric based on the memo (last image):

- **3/3**: Correct, rising log shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote (matches memo closely).
- **2/3**: Incorrect shape (e.g. more linear, not a log curve) but some features present.
- **0/3**: Completely incorrect (e.g. exponential instead of log, or not attempted).

**Grading the students:**

---

### 1. ![S1](attachment:image0)

---

### 3. ![S3](attachment:image2)  
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, correct points and asymptote.

---

### 4. ![S4](attachment:image3)  
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, correct points and asymptote.

---

### 5. ![S5](attachment:image4)  
**3/3**

---

### 8. ![S8](attachment:image7)

---

### 9. ![S9](attachment:image8)

**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, correct points and asymptote.

---

### 13. ![S13](attachment:image12)  
**2/3**

---

### 14. ![S14](attachment:image13)  
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, correct points and asymptote.

---

### 15. ![S15](attachment:image14)  
**2/3**  
- Shape is more exponential than log, does not approach y-axis as asymptote.

---

### 16. ![S16](attachment:image15)

---

### 18. ![S18](attachment:image17)  
**2/3**  
- Shape is not correct (almost horizontal, not log curve).

---

### 19. ![S19](attachment:image18)  
**0/3**  
- Exponential graph included, not a log graph.

---

### 20. ![S20](attachment:image19)  
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, correct points and asymptote.

---

### 21. ![S21](attachment:image20)  
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, correct points and asymptote.

---

---

### 23. ![S23](attachment:image22)  
**2/3**  
- Only the log branch is drawn but not clear if it's associated with axes.

---

### 24. ![S24](attachment:image23)  
**2/3**  
- Only the log branch is drawn but not clear if it's associated with axes.

---

### 26. ![S26](attachment:image25)  
**0/3**  
- Blank, no graph.
