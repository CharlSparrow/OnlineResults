Let's grade each student's graph out of 3, using the memo and the exemplars:

- **3/3:** Correct shape (increasing log), correct x-intercept, and asymptote at \( x = 0 \).
- **2/3:** Mostly correct, but one major feature is wrong (e.g., wrong shape, or wrong x-intercept, but not completely incorrect).
- **0/3:** Completely incorrect, e.g., exponential graph or not a log at all.

### Grading

#### S1 to S6 (for reference and calibration)
- **S1:** 2/3 (shape incorrect, as per your note)
- **S2:** 3/3 (correct shape, x-intercept, and asymptote)
- **S3:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S4:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S5:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S6:** 0/3 (exponential, not a log graph)

#### Continue for S7–S26:
- **S7:** 3/3 (correct shape, correct intercepts and asymptote)
- **S8:** 2/3 (curve is not a standard log shape, especially near the asymptote)
- **S9:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S10:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S11:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S12:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S13:** 2/3 (partially correct, but missing much of the domain and x-intercept is ambiguous)
- **S14:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S15:** 2/3 (does not pass through (1,0), more exponential in shape)
- **S16:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S17:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S18:** 2/3 (curve not quite a log shape, especially for negative values)
- **S19:** 0/3 (shows both log and exponential, does not answer the question correctly)
- **S20:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S21:** 3/3 (correct)
- **S22:** 0/3 (not a log graph)
- **S23:** 0/3 (no axes, no intercept, incomplete, not enough to judge)
- **S24:** 2/3 (has correct log shape, but missing all axes, points, or context)
- **S25:** 0/3 (no graph, just a note)
- **S26:** 0/3 (blank)
