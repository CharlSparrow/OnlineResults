Here are the marks for each student’s graph, using the memo and exemplars (Student 1 = 2/3, Student 6 = 0/3, Memo = 3/3):

---

### MARKS LEGEND:
- **3/3**: Correct shape (increasing log), correct x-intercept, correct vertical asymptote.
- **2/3**: Almost correct but with some error (such as slight shape or point errors, but still recognizable as a log graph).
- **0/3**: Incorrect, completely wrong function (e.g., exponential or not a function at all).

#### Grading:

1. **S1**: 2/3 – Incorrect shape, but log attempt.
2. **S2**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
3. **S3**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
4. **S4**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
5. **S5**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
6. **S6**: 0/3 – Exponential, not a log.
7. **S7**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
8. **S8**: 2/3 – Tries to get log points, but shape is too flat and odd before rising.
9. **S9**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
10. **S10**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
11. **S11**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
12. **S12**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
13. **S13**: 2/3 – Shape and points, but graph is drawn only in positive x, limited domain and messy area.
14. **S14**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
15. **S15**: 2/3 – Shape is off, graph hugs the x-axis too closely before rising.
16. **S16**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
17. **S17**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
18. **S18**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
19. **S19**: 0/3 – Two separate graphs, one exponential and one log, unclear which is the answer.
20. **S20**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
21. **S21**: 3/3 – Correct shape, points, asymptote.
22. **S22**: 0/3 – Not a log, more like a sine/cosine curve.
23. **S23**: 0/3 – Just a diagonal line, not a log.
24. **S24**: 2/3 – Shape is recognizable but no scale, intercepts or asymptote marked.
25. **S25**: 0/3 – No graph submitted, just a note.
26. **S26**: 0/3 – No graph.
