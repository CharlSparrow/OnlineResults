Let's use the memo and your descriptions for 2/3 (Student 1) and 0/3 (Student 6) to mark each student's graph. The memo expects:
- Correct shape (rising log function)
- Correct x-intercept
- Correct asymptote

Let’s grade each:

---

### 1. Student 1: **2/3**
- Shape is incorrect (per your note), but other aspects may be correct.

### 2. Student 2: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 3. Student 3: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 4. Student 4: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 5. Student 5: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 6. Student 6: **0/3**
- Exponential, not a log graph, as per your note.

### 7. Student 7: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 8. Student 8: **2/3**
- The shape is not a standard log curve, more linear for a while, so loses a mark.

### 9. Student 9: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 10. Student 10: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 11. Student 11: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 12. Student 12: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 13. Student 13: **2/3**
- Only a portion of the graph is drawn, missing the left side/asymptote.

### 14. Student 14: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 15. Student 15: **2/3**
- The shape is not a standard log curve, more linear for a while, so loses a mark.

### 16. Student 16: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 17. Student 17: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 18. Student 18: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 19. Student 19: **0/3**
- Two graphs are drawn, one is exponential, so does not meet requirements.

### 20. Student 20: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 21. Student 21: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept (1,0), and asymptote at \(x=0\).

### 22. Student 22: **0/3**
- Not a log graph.

### 23. Student 23: **1/3**
- Only the rising part is drawn, missing axes/labels/asymptote.

### 24. Student 24: **1/3**
- Only the curve is drawn, no axes or intercepts labeled.

### 25. Student 25: **0/3**
- No graph, only text.

### 26. Student 26: **0/3**
- Blank.
