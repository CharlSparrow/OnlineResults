Let's use the memo as the standard for 3/3 (correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and clear asymptote/shape).  
- **Student 1** is an example of a 2/3 (shape incorrect but other features present).
- **Student 6** is a 0/3 (wrong function, exponential).

Let's grade students 1–26:

### Grading:

#### 1. ![S1](attachment:image1)
**2/3**  
- Shape is incorrect (more exponential), but intercepts and points are correct.

#### 2. ![S2](attachment:image2)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept at (1,0), passes through (2,1).

#### 3. ![S3](attachment:image3)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, passes through (1,0) and (1/2,-1).

#### 4. ![S4](attachment:image4)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and key points labeled.

#### 5. ![S5](attachment:image5)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and key points labeled.

#### 6. ![S6](attachment:image6)
**0/3**  
- Exponential, not a log graph.

#### 7. ![S7](attachment:image7)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, labeled points, asymptote clear.

#### 8. ![S8](attachment:image8)
**2/3**  
- General shape is log, but not precise—too flat, then sudden rise; intercept not clearly marked.

#### 9. ![S9](attachment:image9)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 10. ![S10](attachment:image10)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 11. ![S11](attachment:image11)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 12. ![S12](attachment:image12)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 13. ![S13](attachment:image13)
**2/3**  
- Shape is too flat and short, but tries to mark key points.

#### 14. ![S14](attachment:image14)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, passes through labeled points.

#### 15. ![S15](attachment:image15)
**2/3**  
- General shape is log but is too flat for too long, intercept is not clearly shown.

#### 16. ![S16](attachment:image16)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 17. ![S17](attachment:image17)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 18. ![S18](attachment:image18)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 19. ![S19](attachment:image19)
**1/3**  
- Two graphs drawn: one correct log, one exponential. Ambiguous.

#### 20. ![S20](attachment:image20)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 21. ![S21](attachment:image21)
**3/3**  
- Correct log shape, intercept and points labeled.

#### 22. ![S22](attachment:image22)
**0/3**  
- Not a log graph (looks sinusoidal or unrelated).

#### 23. ![S23](attachment:image23)
**1/3**  
- Only the tail of the log is drawn (not a full log graph).

#### 24. ![S24](attachment:image24)
**2/3**  
- Only main branch drawn, no points/intercepts shown.

#### 25. ![S25](attachment:image25)
**0/3**  
- No graph drawn, only a note.

#### 26. ![S26](attachment:image26)
**0/3**  
- Blank.
