Let's use the **memo** for a perfect 3/3 graph:
- Correct logarithmic shape (increasing log function)
- Correct x-intercept
- Correct asymptote

**Student 1** is an example of a **2/3 graph** (incorrect shape, but still a log).
**Student 6** is an example of a **0/3 graph** (drew an exponential, not a log).

Let’s grade students 1–26 using these criteria:

---

### 1. S1: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape, but still a log function.

### 2. S2: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 3. S3: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 4. S4: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 5. S5: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 6. S6: **0/3**
- Exponential, not a log.

### 7. S7: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 8. S8: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape, but has some log-like behavior.

### 9. S9: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 10. S10: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 11. S11: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 12. S12: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 13. S13: **2/3**
- Only partial log drawn, but the shape is there.

### 14. S14: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 15. S15: **2/3**
- Incorrect shape, but some log features.

### 16. S16: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 17. S17: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 18. S18: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 19. S19: **1/3**
- Drew both log and exponential; confusion, but log part is present.

### 20. S20: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 21. S21: **3/3**
- Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, and asymptote.

### 22. S22: **0/3**
- Not a log graph at all.

### 23. S23: **1/3**
- Only drew the vertical part; incomplete log.

### 24. S24: **2/3**
- Has log shape but missing intercepts and labels.

### 25. S25: **0/3**
- No graph, only a written request.

### 26. S26: **0/3**
- Blank.
