Let's use the memo and your exemplars to mark each graph out of 3:

**Marking Guidelines (from memo and exemplars):**
- 3/3: Correct increasing log shape, correct x-intercept, correct asymptote, appropriate points marked (like the memo).
- 2/3: Some correct features, but minor errors (e.g., slightly incorrect shape, missing/incorrect points).
- 0/3: Incorrect type of graph (e.g., exponential, straight line, or completely missing).

### Student Grades

1. **S1:** 2/3  
   - Shape is not correct (see your exemplar).

2. **S2:** 3/3  
   - Good log shape, correct intercepts, reasonable asymptote.

3. **S3:** 3/3  
   - Good shape, correct points, matches memo.

4. **S4:** 3/3  
   - Correct log shape, intercepts and asymptote.

5. **S5:** 3/3  
   - Correct log shape, intercepts and asymptote.

6. **S6:** 0/3  
   - Exponential graph, not log (your 0/3 exemplar).

7. **S7:** 3/3  
   - Correct log shape, points, intercept.

8. **S8:** 2/3  
   - Shape is not quite log-like, but some points are correct.

9. **S9:** 3/3  
   - Correct log shape, points, asymptote.

10. **S10:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, intercepts.

11. **S11:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, points.

12. **S12:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, points, asymptote.

13. **S13:** 2/3  
    - Shape is generally right, but missing left part, shading is odd.

14. **S14:** 3/3  
    - Good log shape, intercepts.

15. **S15:** 2/3  
    - Not a clear log shape, but points are labeled.

16. **S16:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, points.

17. **S17:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, points.

18. **S18:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, points.

19. **S19:** 2/3  
    - Draws both log and exponential, some confusion, but log part is there.

20. **S20:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, points.

21. **S21:** 3/3  
    - Correct log shape, points.

22. **S22:** 0/3  
    - Not a log graph, looks like a sine wave.

23. **S23:** 1/3  
    - Only a single curve with no axes or points, not enough info.

24. **S24:** 1/3  
    - Only the general curve, no axes or points.

25. **S25:** 0/3  
    - No graph, only instructions.

26. **S26:** 0/3  
    - Blank, no attempt.
