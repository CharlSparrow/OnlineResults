Let's grade each student's graph out of 3, using the memo as a guide:
- **Correct increasing logarithmic shape** (vorm)
- **Correct x-intercept at (1, 0)**
- **Correct asymptote at \(x = 0\)** (vertical asymptote)

---

### Grades

#### S1: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (0,1) (should be (1,0)), so error here.
- Asymptote: At x = 0
- **Grade: 2/3**

#### S2: **2/3**
- Shape: correct, but the x-intercept is at (1,0), which is correct.
- Asymptote: At x = 0.
- But the shape looks slightly off, as it flattens too soon.
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S3: **2/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0) is correct
- Asymptote: At x = 0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S4: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0) correct
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S5: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0) correct
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S6: **0/3**
- Completely wrong shape, seems like two functions, not logarithmic.
- **Grade: 0/3**

#### S7: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0) correct
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S8: **2/3**
- Shape: a bit off, especially at negative x-values (log function not defined for x ≤ 0).
- x-intercept: (2,1) and (4,2) are not correct for the standard log function.
- **Grade: 1/3**

#### S9: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S10: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S11: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S12: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S13: **1/3**
- Very incomplete, only positive x-values, and not the correct log curve.
- **Grade: 1/3**

#### S14: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S15: **2/3**
- Shape: somewhat correct, but only positive x plotted; does not show vertical asymptote clearly.
- **Grade: 2/3**

#### S16: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S17: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S18: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S19: **2/3**
- Two curves drawn, one is correct
- **Grade: 2/3**

#### S20: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S21: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: (1,0)
- Asymptote: at x=0
- **Grade: 3/3**

#### S22: **0/3**
- Not a log shape, just a wavy curve
- **Grade: 0/3**

#### S23: **1/3**
- Only drew the general increasing shape, missing axes, intercepts, and asymptotes
- **Grade: 1/3**

#### S24: **1/3**
- Only drew a general shape, not enough detail, missing intercepts, and asymptote
- **Grade: 1/3**

#### S25: **0/3**
- No graph, just a written instruction to give full marks
- **Grade: 0/3**

#### S26: **0/3**
- Blank page
- **Grade: 0/3**
