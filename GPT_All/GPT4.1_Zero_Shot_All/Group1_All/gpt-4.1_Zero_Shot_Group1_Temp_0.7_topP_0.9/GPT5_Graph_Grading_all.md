Let's use the memo for marking:
- **Correct shape** (increasing logarithmic function) = 1 mark
- **Correct x-intercept** \((1,0)\) = 1 mark
- **Correct asymptote** (\(y\)-axis or \(x=0\)) = 1 mark

Let's grade each student's graph out of 3:

### S1
- Shape: Correct
- x-intercept: Incorrect (\((0,1)\) instead of \((1,0)\))
