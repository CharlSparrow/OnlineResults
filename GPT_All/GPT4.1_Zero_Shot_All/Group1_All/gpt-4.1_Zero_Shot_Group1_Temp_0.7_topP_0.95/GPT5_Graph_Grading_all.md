Let's use the memo to mark each graph out of 3. The memo gives marks for:
- Correct general **shape** (increasing log function)
- Correct **x-intercept** (at (1,0))
- Correct **asymptote** (y-axis, i.e., \( x = 0 \))

Let's grade each student's graph:

---

**S1:**  
- Correct shape: ✔️  
- x-intercept: ❌ (shows (0,1) as x-intercept, incorrect)
- Asymptote: ✔️  
**Mark: 2/3**

---

**S2:**  
- Correct shape: ✔️  
- x-intercept: ✔️ (at (1,0))
- Asymptote: ✔️  
**Mark: 3/3**
