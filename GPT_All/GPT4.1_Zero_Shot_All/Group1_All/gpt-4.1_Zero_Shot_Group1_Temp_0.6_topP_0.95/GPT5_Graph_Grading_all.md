Let's use the memo to grade the student graphs out of 3:

**Memo Marking Criteria:**
1. Correct shape (increasing log function)
2. Correct x-intercept (at (1, 0))
3. Asymptote (y-axis, x = 0)

### Grading

#### S1
- Shape: Correct
- x-intercept: Missing/incorrect (has (0,1) instead of (1,0))
- Asymptote: Correct
**Score: 2/3**

#### S2
- Shape: Correct
- x-intercept: Correct (at (1,0))
- Asymptote: Correct
**Score: 3/3**

#### S3
- Shape: Correct
- x-intercept: Correct (at (1,0))
- Asymptote: Not clearly indicated, but implied
**Score: 2.5/3** (Rounded to **3/3** if partial marks not allowed)
