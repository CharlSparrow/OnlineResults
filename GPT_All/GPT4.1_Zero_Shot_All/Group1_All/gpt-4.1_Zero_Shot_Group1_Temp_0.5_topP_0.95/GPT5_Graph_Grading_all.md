Let's use the memo to guide the marking. The memo awards 1 mark each for:
1. Correct shape (increasing logarithmic function)
2. Correct x-intercept at (1;0)
3. Correct asymptote (vertical, at \( x=0 \))

Let's grade each student's graph out of 3:

---

### S1
- Shape: Correct
- x-intercept: **Not marked** (marked (0,1) instead of (1,0))
- Asymptote: Correct (at \( x=0 \))
- **Mark: 2/3**

---

### S2
- Shape: Correct
- x-intercept: Correct (marked (1,0))
- Asymptote: Correct (at \( x=0 \))
- **Mark: 3/3**
