Let's use the memo to grade each student's graph out of 3. The memo gives marks for:
1. Correct **shape** (increasing log function)
2. Correct **x-intercept** (should be at (1,0))
3. Correct **asymptote** (vertical asymptote at \(x=0\))

### Grading

- Incorrect shape (piecewise linear, not log)
- Incorrect x-intercept
- No asymptote

#### S2: **1/3**
- Shape is not quite right (too linear, not log curve)
- Correct x-intercept at (1,0)
- No clear asymptote

#### S3: **3/3**
- Correct shape (log curve)
- Correct x-intercept (1,0)
- Asymptote at \(x=0\)

- Correct x-intercept (1,0)
- Asymptote at \(x=0\)

#### S5: **3/3**
- Correct shape
- Correct x-intercept (1,0)
- Asymptote at \(x=0\)

#### S6: **2/3**
- Correct shape for \(h^{-1}\) but also drew another function (h)
- Correct x-intercept (1,0)
- Asymptote at \(x=0\)

#### S7: **3/3**
- Correct shape
- Correct x-intercept (1,0)
- Asymptote at \(x=0\)

#### S12: **3/3**
- Correct shape
- Correct x-intercept (1,0)
- Asymptote at \(x=0\)

#### S13: **1/3**
- The top graph is incorrect and scribbled out, the bottom graph is piecewise linear, not log
- X-intercept at (1,0)
- No asymptote

#### S14: **3/3**
