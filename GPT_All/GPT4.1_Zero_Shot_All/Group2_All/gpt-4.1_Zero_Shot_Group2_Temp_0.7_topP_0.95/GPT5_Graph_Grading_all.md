Let's use the memo for grading. The memo awards 1 mark each for:
- Correct general shape (increasing logarithmic function)
- Correct x-intercept at (1,0)
- Correct asymptote (vertical, at \(x=0\))

### Grading the Students' Graphs (X/3):

---

#### S1: **0/3**
- Incorrect shape (piecewise linear, not logarithmic), x-intercept at (1,0) but rest is wrong, no asymptote.

#### S2: **2/3**
- Correct shape and x-intercept at (1,0). Asymptote not clearly drawn/labelled.

#### S3: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), and passing through (1/2, -1) (asymptote is visually implied by the approach to \(x=0\)).

#### S4: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passing through (1/2, -1), asymptote at \(x=0\).

#### S5: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passing through (1/2, -1), asymptote at \(x=0\).

#### S6: **2/3**
- Both \(h\) and \(h^{-1}\) are drawn. The \(h^{-1}\) curve is correct (shape, x-intercept, asymptote), but the extra function is distracting and could cost a mark for clarity.

#### S7: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), and correct approach to asymptote.

#### S8: **1/3**
- Incorrect shape (looks almost linear for a portion), only correct x-intercept at (2,1), asymptote not at \(x=0\).

#### S9: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passes through (1/2, -1), clear asymptote.

#### S10: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passes through (1/2, -1), approaches asymptote.

#### S11: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passes through (1/2, -1), clear asymptote.

#### S12: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passes through (2,1) and (4,2), approaches asymptote.

#### S13: **1/3**
- Top graph is scribbled out. Bottom graph has correct points (2,1), (4,2) but shape is too linear and doesn’t show correct log curve or asymptote.

#### S14: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passes through multiple correct points, clear asymptote.

#### S15: **1/3**
- Shape is not correct, but x-intercept at (2,1) is marked. Asymptote not at \(x=0\).

#### S16: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passes through (1/2, -1), clear asymptote.

#### S17: **2/3**
- Shape is correct, x-intercept at (1,0), but not enough info to confirm asymptote is at \(x=0\) (no negative x).

#### S18: **2/3**
- Shape is close, points marked, but asymptote not clear.

#### S19: **2/3**
- Both \(h\) and \(h^{-1}\) drawn, \(h^{-1}\) is correct (shape, x-intercept), but distracting extra function.

#### S20: **2/3**
- Shape and x-intercept correct, asymptote is not labelled but implied.

#### S21: **3/3**
- Correct shape, x-intercept at (1,0), passes through (1/2, -1), clear asymptote.

#### S22: **0/3**
- Incorrect shape, not a log graph, no intercepts/asymptote.

#### S23: **1/3**
- Only the general direction (down then up) is vaguely correct, but no axes, intercept, or asymptote.

#### S24: **1/3**
- Only general shape, but not clearly a log function, no axes, intercept, or asymptote.

#### S25: **0/3**
- No graph, only a request for full marks.

#### S26: **0/3**
- Blank.
