Let's use the memo to grade the students' graphs out of 3. The memo requires:
1. Correct general shape (increasing logarithmic function)
2. Correct x-intercept at (1, 0)
3. Correct asymptote (vertical asymptote at \(x=0\)), and ideally the point \((\frac{1}{2},-1)\).

Let's grade each one:

---

### S1: **0/3**
- Incorrect shape (linear, not logarithmic)
- Incorrect x-intercept
- No asymptote

---

### S2: **1/3**
- Shape: somewhat correct (increasing, but not logarithmic)
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote: not clear

---

### S3: **3/3**
- Correct shape (increasing log)
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**
- Point \((\frac{1}{2},-1)\): **yes**

---

### S4: **2/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote: not clearly shown (should be at \(x=0\)), curve starts to the left of y-axis

---

### S5: **2/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote: not clearly marked, but implied

---

### S6: **1/3**
- Shape: Both log and exponential drawn, but the log is correct
- x-intercept: not clearly marked
- Asymptote: not clearly marked

---

### S7: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**
- Points (2,1) and (4,2) also shown

---

### S8: **1/3**
- Shape: not correct (looks more like an exponential)
- x-intercept: not at (1,0)
- Asymptote: not clear

---

### S9: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S10: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S11: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S12: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S13: **1/3**
- Shape: correct in lower graph, but upper graph is a mess
- x-intercept: not clearly marked
- Asymptote: not clear

---

### S14: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S15: **1/3**
- Shape: not correct (exponential, not log)
- x-intercept: not at (1,0)
- Asymptote: not clear

---

### S16: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S17: **2/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote: not clearly shown (curve should approach \(x=0\))

---

### S18: **2/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: not at (1,0)
- Asymptote: yes

---

### S19: **2/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: not clearly marked
- Asymptote: yes

---

### S20: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S21: **3/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept at (1,0): **yes**
- Asymptote at \(x=0\): **yes**

---

### S22: **0/3**
- Shape: not correct
- x-intercept: not at (1,0)
- Asymptote: not present

---

### S23: **1/3**
- Shape: not correct (just a line)
- x-intercept: not shown
- Asymptote: not shown

---

### S24: **2/3**
- Shape: correct
- x-intercept: not marked
- Asymptote: yes

---

### S25: **0/3**
- No graph, just a request for marks

---

### S26: **0/3**
- Blank
