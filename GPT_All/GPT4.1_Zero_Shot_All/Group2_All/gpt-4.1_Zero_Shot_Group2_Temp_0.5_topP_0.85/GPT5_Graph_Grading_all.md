Let's use the memo to grade each graph out of 3. The memo awards marks for:
1. **Correct shape** (increasing logarithmic function)
2. **x-intercept** at (1;0)
3. **Asymptote** at \( x = 0 \)

Let's grade each student:

---

### S1: **0/3**
- Incorrect shape (looks linear and not logarithmic)
- x-intercept is at (1,1), not (1,0)
- No clear asymptote at x=0

---

### S2: **1/3**
- Shape is somewhat correct but not logarithmic enough, and domain is incorrect (goes left of x=0).
- x-intercept is at (1,0) ✔️
- No clear asymptote at x=0

---

### S3: **2/3**
- Correct shape (logarithmic and increasing) ✔️
- x-intercept at (1,0) ✔️
- Asymptote is not clearly indicated, but implied by the curve

---

### S4: **3/3**
- Correct shape ✔️
- x-intercept at (1,0) ✔️
- Asymptote at x=0 is clear ✔️

---

### S5: **3/3**
- Correct shape ✔️
- x-intercept at (1,0) ✔️
- Asymptote at x=0 is clear ✔️
