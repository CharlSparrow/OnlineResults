Let's use the memo for grading:

**Memo:**
- Correct increasing log function shape (**vorm**)
- Correct x-intercept at (1;0) (**x-afsnit**)
- Correct asymptote at \( x = 0 \) (**assimptoot**)
- Each worth 1 mark (total: 3 marks).

---

### Grading the Students:

#### 1. S1: **0/3**
- Incorrect: straight lines, not log shape, incorrect x-intercept, and incorrect asymptote.

#### 2. S2: **1/3**
- Log shape, but x-intercept at (1,0) not clear, asymptote implied but not shown. Partial mark for attempt at log shape.

#### 3. S3: **2/3**
- Good log shape and x-intercept at (1,0), but no vertical asymptote drawn (no indication for x=0).

#### 4. S4: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, correct x-intercept at (1,0), clear asymptote at x=0.

#### 5. S5: **2/3**
- Has correct x-intercept, asymptote implied, shape is almost log but too straight for full marks.

#### 6. S6: **1/3**
- Graph of both h and h⁻¹. Log shape is correct for inverse, but unnecessary extra graph, and not all required points are labeled.

#### 7. S7: **2/3**
- Log shape correct, (1,0) is labeled. No asymptote indicated.

#### 8. S8: **1/3**
- Exponential shape, not a log. Only correct x-intercept.

#### 9. S9: **2/3**
- Log shape, (1,0) labeled, but asymptote not clearly marked.

#### 10. S10: **2/3**
- Log shape, (1,0) labeled, asymptote not marked.

#### 11. S11: **2/3**
- Log shape, (1,0) labeled, no clear asymptote.

#### 12. S12: **3/3**
- Log shape, (1,0) labeled, vertical asymptote at x=0.

#### 13. S13: **1/3**
- Lower graph is log shaped but no x-intercept nor asymptote labeled. Upper graph irrelevant.

#### 14. S14: **3/3**
- Correct log shape, (1,0), asymptote at x=0.

#### 15. S15: **1/3**
- Exponential, not log shape.

#### 16. S16: **2/3**
- Log shape and (1,0) labeled, no asymptote indicated.

#### 17. S17: **2/3**
- Correct log shape, (1,0) shown, no asymptote.

#### 18. S18: **1/3**
- Log-ish but horizontal asymptote, not vertical.

#### 19. S19: **1/3**
- Two graphs, but inverse log’s shape is correct.

#### 20. S20: **2/3**
- Log shape, (1,0) clear, asymptote not labeled.

#### 21. S21: **2/3**
- Correct log shape, (1,0), asymptote not indicated.

#### 22. S22: **0/3**
- Not a log shape, no features.

#### 23. S23: **1/3**
- Only a line, not a log, only gets mark for a general direction.

#### 24. S24: **2/3**
- Log shape, but no features marked.

#### 25. S25: **0/3**
- No graph, only text.

#### 26. S26: **0/3**
- Blank.
