Let's use the memo to grade each student's graph out of 3. The memo awards marks for:

1. Correct shape (increasing logarithmic function)
2. Correct \(x\)-intercept (at (1;0))
3. Correct asymptote (vertical at \(x=0\))

Let's grade each student:

---

### S1
- Shape: Incorrect (looks linear)
- \(x\)-intercept: Incorrect (not at (1;0))
- Asymptote: Incorrect (none)
- **Score: 0/3**

---

- Shape: Correct (log-like)
- \(x\)-intercept: Correct (at (1;0))
- Asymptote: Not clearly shown, but suggested
