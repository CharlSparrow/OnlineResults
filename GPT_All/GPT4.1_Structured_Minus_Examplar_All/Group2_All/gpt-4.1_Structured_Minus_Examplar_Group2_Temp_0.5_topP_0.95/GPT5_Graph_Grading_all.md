Let's apply the memo rubric to each student's graph:

**Memo Rubric:**
1. **Shape (Vorm):** Does the graph have the correct general shape for a logarithmic function with base 2 (rising to the right, never crossing the y-axis)?
2. **x-intercept (x-afsnit):** Is the x-intercept at (1,0) marked or labeled, or otherwise indicated?
3. **Asymptote (Assimptoot):** Does the graph respect the vertical asymptote at \(x = 0\) (never crosses y-axis)?
