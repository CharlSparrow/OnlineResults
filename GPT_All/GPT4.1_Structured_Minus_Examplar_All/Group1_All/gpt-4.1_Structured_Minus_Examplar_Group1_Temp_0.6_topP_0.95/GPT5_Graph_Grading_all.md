Let's grade each student's graph according to the three criteria:
1. **Shape (vorm)**: Should look like a rising logarithmic curve (rightward, increasing, with a vertical asymptote at x=0).
2. **x-intercept (x-afsnit)**: Correct if (1;0) is marked, or a point at x=1 on the x-axis is indicated.
3. **Asymptote (assimptoot)**: Should not cross the y-axis; ambiguous cases get the mark.

### Grading:

#### S1
- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: **No** (x-intercept at (0;1) is marked, not (1;0))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **2/3**

#### S2
- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: Yes (marked (1;0))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **3/3**

#### S3
- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: Yes (marked (1;0))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **3/3**

#### S4
- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: Yes (marked (1;0))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **3/3**

#### S5
- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: Yes (marked (1;0))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **3/3**

#### S6
- Shape: **No** (looks like exponential, not log)

- Asymptote: **No** (crosses y-axis)
- **0/3**

#### S7
- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: Yes (marked (1;0))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **3/3**

#### S8

#### S13
- Shape: **No** (not a log curve, only a small piece of the curve, and the rest is scribbled out)
- x-intercept: **No** ((1;0) not marked)
- Asymptote: **No** (hard to tell, but not enough curve shown)
- **0/3**

#### S14
- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: Yes (marked (1;0))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **3/3**

- Shape: Yes
- x-intercept: **No** ((1;0) not marked, only (2;1) and (0;3))
- Asymptote: Yes
- **2/3**

#### S19
- Shape: Yes
