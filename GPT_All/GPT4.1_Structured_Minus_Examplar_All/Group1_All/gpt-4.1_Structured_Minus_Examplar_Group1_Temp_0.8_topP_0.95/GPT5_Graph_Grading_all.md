Let's grade each student's graph according to the provided memorandum (max: 3 marks):

**Criteria Recap**:
- **Shape (vorm):** Logarithmic, increasing, roughly correct orientation.
- **X-intercept (x-afsnit):** Correctly marked/written at (1;0) or equivalent.
- **Asymptote (assimptoot):** Graph does not cross y-axis.

- **Shape:** Incorrect (looks like exponential, not logarithmic)
- **X-intercept:** Incorrect, (0;1) marked
- **Asymptote:** Yes, does not cross y-axis.
- **Total: 1/3**

#### S2
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Correct, (1;0)
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S3
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Correct, (1;0)
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S4
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Correct, (1;0)
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S5
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Correct, (1;0)
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S6
- **Shape:** Incorrect (two curves, not a single log)
- **X-intercept:** Not correctly labeled
- **Asymptote:** Not clear, main line crosses y-axis
- **Total: 0/3**

#### S7
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Correct, (1;0)
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S8
- **Shape:** Somewhat correct, but poorly drawn, flattens at first
- **X-intercept:** Not marked at all
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 1/3** (Shape is ambiguous, but does not cross y-axis, give mark for asymptote)

- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S12
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Correct, (1;0)
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S13
- **Shape:** Only rightmost piece, but correct general shape
- **X-intercept:** Not marked at all
- **Asymptote:** Does not cross y-axis
- **Total: 2/3**

#### S14
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Correct, (1;0)
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 3/3**

#### S15

- **X-intercept:** Not marked
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 1/3**

#### S16

#### S18
- **Shape:** Correct
- **X-intercept:** Not marked
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 2/3**

#### S19
- **Shape:** Correct (log drawn), although there's an extra exponential
- **X-intercept:** Not marked
- **Asymptote:** Correct
- **Total: 2/3**

#### S20
