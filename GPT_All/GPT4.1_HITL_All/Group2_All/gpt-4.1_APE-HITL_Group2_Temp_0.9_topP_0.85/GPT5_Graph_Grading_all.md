Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): “1”, unlabeled dot at x=1; Accepted for X: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing, but mostly straight with weak concavity.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: 0 — The curve is mostly straight with only a slight bend; lacks clear concave down and steep-to-flat cues.  
• x-intercept: 0 — The dot at x=1 is not labeled as (1;0) or x=1, nor is there a label attached to h⁻¹, so no valid token.  
• Asymptote: 1 — Entire curve remains in x>0, no segment on or left of the y-axis.
