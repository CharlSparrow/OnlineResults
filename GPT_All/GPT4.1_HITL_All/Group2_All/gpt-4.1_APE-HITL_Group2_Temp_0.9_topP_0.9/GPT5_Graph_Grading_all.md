Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,0]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: continuous segment ~origin to -2.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): unlabeled dot at x=1; Accepted for X: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing, mostly straight with slight bend, not concave down majority.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: 1 as both ends bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible; borderline concave down.  
• x-intercept: 0 because there is no acceptable token (“(1;0)”, “x=1”, or labeled dot with “1”) attached to h⁻¹.  
• Asymptote: 0 as the curve visibly extends into x≤0, continuous segment left of y-axis.
