Student 1  
Mark: `0/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): “(0;1)”; Accepted for X: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing, concave down, but no valid X token at (1;0).  
Reasons:  
• Shape: Curve shape is correct (increasing, concave down, steep left tail), but not awarded since X-intercept is invalid.  
• x-intercept: No acceptable token; “(0;1)” is not valid for h⁻¹ at (1;0).  
• Asymptote: Curve remains in x>0, but not awarded due to X-intercept error.
