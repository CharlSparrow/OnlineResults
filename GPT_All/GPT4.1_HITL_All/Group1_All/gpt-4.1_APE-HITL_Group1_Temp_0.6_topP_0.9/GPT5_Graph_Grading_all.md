Student 1  
Mark: `0/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,0]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): “(0;1)”; Accepted for X: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: The shape is correct (increasing and concave down), but Rule 2 for X-intercept is not met.  
• x-intercept: No acceptable token for x-intercept at (1;0) attached to h⁻¹; only (0;1) is present.  
• Asymptote: Stays right of y-axis, so would be correct if other criteria met, but X=0 so cannot award.
