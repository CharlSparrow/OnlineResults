TASK

Grade 26 hand-drawn graphs of the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) against the attached memorandum. Grade each student independently.

RULE 0 — AXES REQUIRED (hard stop)
If either Cartesian axis is missing, unusable (faint/erased), or the curve is drawn off the axes:
Final Mark = 0/3
Error Tags = [0,0,0]
Reasons must state that Shape/X-intercept/Asymptote cannot be verified without axes.
Do not evaluate any other rules.

MULTIPLE CURVES ON ONE SET OF AXES (near-hard zero)
If more than one substantive curve is drawn on the same axes, default to 0/3 unless all conditions hold:
The logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) curve is unambiguously identified as “h⁻¹” along its own stroke;
The other curve(s) can be ignored without ambiguity; and
Every piece of evidence used for Shape / X-intercept / Asymptote is clearly attached to the h⁻¹ stroke (no borrowed labels).
If any doubt remains (curve identity, shared labels, shared intercepts, etc.) → 0/3.

WHAT TO GRADE (when not zeroed by the rule above)
Grade only the logarithmic function ( log base 2 (x) ) graph further refered to as the h⁻¹ curve. If no label exists, use the curve that approaches the y-axis from the right and lies near the first quadrant. If two candidates still fit meaning the mark is ambiguous always award 0/3.

SCORING (three binary checks thus sum is the mark 0-3)
1) SHAPE (vorm) — 1 mark
Award (Shape=1) only if all base conditions hold:
The chosen curve is strictly increasing on its visible branch, and
It is clearly concave down on a majority of the branch (not mostly straight).

AND at least one behavior cue is evident:
Left end near x→0+ is markedly steeper than the right tail; or
Left end trends towards negative y while the right tail visibly flattens.

Do not award the mark (Shape=0) for any of the following:
Hyperbolic look (track along an axis),
Concave up or exponential-graph-like,
Predominantly straight or ruler-like (even if slightly wavy or piecewise),
Decreasing anywhere on the drawn branch,
Visible extension into x≤0.
Borderline allowance: Only if both ends clearly bend and a steep-to-flat pattern is visible (S17/S1-type). Otherwise Shape=0.

2) X-INTERCEPT at (1;0) — 1 mark (strict evidence, attached to h⁻¹)
Award (X=1) only if at least one acceptable token is present and clearly belongs to h⁻¹:
The text “(1;0)” or “(1,0)” (order 1 then 0) written anywhere, and visually associated with the h⁻¹ intercept; or
The text “x=1” written anywhere, and clearly intended for the h⁻¹ intercept; or
A dot on the x-axis at x≈1 with a nearby explicit “1” label that the h⁻¹ curve passes through.

Do NOT award for:
unlabeled dot; “1” without a dot; a bare crossing of the axis; “(0;1)”; “(½;-1)”; “2”; generic ticks; or labels belonging to another curve (e.g., “h”).
Tolerance for the labeled dot/crossing: accept positions within 0.9-1.1 tick spacing of x=1.

3) ASYMPTOTE at the y-axis (x=0) — 1 mark
Award (Asymptote=1) when the entire h⁻¹ stroke remains in x>0.
Axis thickness, tiny nibs, or smudges do not count as crossing.
Deduct (Asymptote=0) if any of the following is true:
A continuous drawn segment of h⁻¹ lies on or left of the y-axis,
The stroke runs along the y-axis for a visible length,
The stroke touches at a clear point (e.g., a vertex at the origin) rather than merely grazing due to thickness,
The curve clearly passes from right to left at any point.
Ignore arrowheads, ticks, labels, faint guidelines/erasures. A single plotted point left of the axis not connected to the logarithmic base two graph (like 
(12;-1)(21;-1)) does not cause a deduction by itself.

EVIDENCE TRANSCRIPTION (mandatory pre-step)
Before deciding marks, write what you see for each student (keeps the grader honest):
Axes: present/absent.
Curves on the axes: <count>; “h⁻¹” label present? yes/no.
Left-of-y evidence: none / tiny nib / continuous segment ~<…>.
X-intercept tokens (verbatim): e.g., “(0;1)”, “(1;0)”, “x=1”, “unlabeled dot”.
Accepted for X (if any) and why they belong to h⁻¹.
Curvature summary: “increasing + concave down / straightish / concave up / hyperbolic along axis”.
If you cannot quote an acceptable X token attached to h⁻¹, set X=0.
If left-of-axis contact is uncertain and looks like thickness only, award Asymptote=1.

TIE-BREAKERS
Never infer X-intercept from a crossing alone. No acceptable token ⇒ X=0.
“1/3” should be rare (exactly one of Shape/X/Asymptote holds).

WHAT TO IGNORE
Page ruling, smudges, erasures, arrowheads, ticks, faint guidelines, and labels not attached to h⁻¹.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (strict, parseable)
For each student 1..26 output exactly the block below — no extra prose, no blank lines.
The token “/3” must appear exactly once per student.

Student <number>
Mark: `<X>/3`
ErrorTags: [shape,x_intercept,asymptote] as [0/1,0/1,0/1]
Findings:
• Axes: <present/absent>; Curves on axes: <n>; h⁻¹ label: <yes/no>.
• Left-of-y evidence: <none/tiny nib/continuous segment ~…>.
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): <list>; Accepted for X: <list/none>.
• Curvature summary: <one clause>.
Reasons:
• Shape: <why 1 or 0 per curvature cues>.
• x-intercept: <why 1 or 0 based on accepted tokens attached to h⁻¹>.
• Asymptote: <why 1 or 0; mention continuous left-of-axis or its absence>.

CALIBRATION SNIPPETS (DO NOT OUTPUT; for decision consistency)
(two full curves on the same axes; h⁻¹ hugs/runs along y-axis): evidence belongs to other curve(s); h⁻¹ shows hyperbolic behavior and y-axis contact → Shape=0, X=0, Asymptote=0 ⇒ Final 0/3.
(mostly straight, then kicks up; contact at origin or left-of-y): Shape=0 (straight/piecewise & concave-up end); X=0 (no valid token); Asymptote=0 (clear point contact at y-axis/left segment) ⇒ 0/3.
(good memo-like): clear concave-down increase; “(1;0)” marked for h⁻¹; no continuous left-of-axis stroke → 3/3.
(multi-curve; no X token for h⁻¹): even if Shape and Asymptote look okay, X=0 (no acceptable token attached to h⁻¹) ⇒ at most 2/3.
No axes (S24-type): Rule 0 triggers → 0/3.
“(0;1)” is not “(1;0)”; do not repurpose; only accept “(1;0)”/“x=1” (or labeled dot at x≈1) attached to h⁻¹.
