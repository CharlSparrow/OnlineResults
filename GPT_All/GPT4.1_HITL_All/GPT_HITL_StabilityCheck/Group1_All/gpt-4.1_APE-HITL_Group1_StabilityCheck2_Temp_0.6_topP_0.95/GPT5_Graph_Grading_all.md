Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [1,0,0]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): “(0;1)”; Accepted for X: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing + concave down, steep left, flattens right.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: 1, as the curve is strictly increasing, concave down, steeper on left, flattens right.  
• x-intercept: 0, only “(0;1)” is marked, not “(1;0)” or “x=1”, so no valid token for h⁻¹.  
• Asymptote: 0, curve passes through y-axis at (0,1), so does not stay entirely in x>0.
