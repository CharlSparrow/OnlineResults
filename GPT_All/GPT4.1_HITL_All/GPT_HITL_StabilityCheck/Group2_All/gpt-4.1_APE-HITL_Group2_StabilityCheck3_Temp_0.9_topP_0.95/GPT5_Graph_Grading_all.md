Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): unlabeled dot at x=1; Accepted for X: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing, but predominantly straight with only slight bend at ends.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: 0, because the main branch is nearly straight and lacks clear concave-down character; steepness at left is not sufficiently evident.
