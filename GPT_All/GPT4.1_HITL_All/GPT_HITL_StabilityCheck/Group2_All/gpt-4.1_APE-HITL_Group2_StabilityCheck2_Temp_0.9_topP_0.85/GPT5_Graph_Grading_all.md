Student 1  
Mark: `1/3`  
ErrorTags: [0,0,1]  
Findings:  
• Axes: present; Curves on axes: 1; h⁻¹ label: yes.  
• Left-of-y evidence: none.  
• X-intercept tokens (verbatim): “1” (x-axis tick, not marked at intercept), unlabeled dot at x=1.  
• Accepted for X: none.  
• Curvature summary: increasing, predominantly straight with a slight bend, not clearly concave down.  
Reasons:  
• Shape: 0 — Curve is mostly straight with only a mild concave-down suggestion at ends, fails majority concave-down requirement.
